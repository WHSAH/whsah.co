                        A Method for Preparing Estradiol</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
                        The invention belongs to the field of biological
                        cell engineering and relates to a method for
                        preparing estradiol, specifically involving the
                        use of induced mammalian cells cultured in vitro
                        to produce estradiol. The method employs a cell
                        population derived from mammalian cells through
                        special induction in vitro, which, under
                        specific culture conditions, continuously
                        secretes estrogen. The system simulates the
                        natural biosynthesis process in vivo, resulting
                        in fewer by-products, simplicity, mild
                        conditions, and minimal environmental harm.
                        Compared to existing preparation methods, it
                        offers irreplaceable advantages. The invention
                        provides a novel pathway for obtaining estradiol
                        by enabling somatic cells of mammals to produce
                        estradiol after induction under specific
                        conditions in vitro.</p></li>

                        <p><strong>[0001]</strong> The invention
                        pertains to biological cell engineering and
                        provides a method for preparing estradiol using
                        induced mammalian cells cultured in vitro.</p>
                        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
                        <p><strong>[0002]</strong> The prior art
                        discloses that there are three main
                        physiologically existing estrogens in the human
                        body: estradiol, estrone, and estriol. These are
                        primarily generated by the ovaries, follicles,
                        corpus luteum, and placental tissue during
                        pregnancy, and are of great significance for
                        maintaining female secondary sexual
                        characteristics. Estrogen deficiency can lead to
                        functional decline in multiple organs of the
                        female body. Data shows that when women enter
                        menopause, estrogen levels drop sharply. In the
                        United States alone, the market value of
                        estrogen replacement drugs for menopausal women
                        has reached nearly 20 billion US dollars.</p>
                        <p><strong>[0003]</strong> Currently, the most
                        commonly used drugs for estrogen supplementation
                        fall into two categories: one being estrone
                        derived from horse urine, and the other being
                        chemically synthesized estradiol. Equine-derived
                        estrone was the earliest estrogen replacement
                        therapy and has been widely used worldwide for
                        decades, becoming virtually synonymous with
                        estrogen itself. Its preparation and
                        purification methods are now quite mature.
                        However, research shows that the estrogen
                        actually needed by the human body is estradiol,
                        while the estrogen components in pregnant mare’s
                        urine mainly consist of estrone, equilin, and
                        equilenin. The mentioned estrone is a metabolite
                        of estradiol, with biological activity less than
                        one-tenth that of estradiol, and carries toxic
                        side effects including increased cardiovascular
                        disease risk, liver damage, and breast cancer.
                        Due to these significant adverse effects,
                        estrone is commonly regarded as a “bad
                        estrogen.”</p>
                        <p><strong>[0004]</strong> Estradiol is
                        primarily sourced from chemical synthesis.
                        However, chemically synthesized estradiol
                        presents problems including lengthy synthetic
                        pathways, numerous byproducts, and environmental
                        pollution. The ecological issues caused by
                        estrogen analogs discharged into the environment
                        have become increasingly concerning. As steroid
                        hormones, estrogens differ from protein hormones
                        in that they cannot be produced through the
                        conventional bioengineering pathway of
                        “DNA→mRNA→protein”, and can only be synthesized
                        intracellularly using cholesterol as a substrate
                        through enzymatic systems.</p>
                        <p>Under physiological conditions, estrogens
                        mainly originate from theca cells and granulosa
                        cells of ovarian follicles. During follicular
                        development, luteinizing hormone (LH) first
                        stimulates theca cells to secrete testosterone,
                        which is then converted to estradiol by
                        granulosa cells under the stimulation of
                        follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and further
                        metabolized into other estrogen components.
                        Estrogen production involves coordinated actions
                        among multiple cell types and hormones. Due to
                        the extremely complex regulatory networks
                        between various cells and hormones, cell
                        engineering approaches for estrogen production
                        face significant difficulties. To date, there
                        have been no reports on successful cell
                        engineering-based preparation of estrogens.</p>

                        Invention</h3>
                        <p><strong>[0007]</strong> The objective of the
                        present invention is to overcome the
                        deficiencies and shortcomings of existing
                        technologies by providing a method for preparing
                        estradiol. Specifically, the invention relates
                        to a method for preparing estradiol through
                        genetic engineering or cell engineering, with
                        particular emphasis on the use of induced
                        mammalian cells cultured in vitro to produce
                        estradiol. This method establishes an in vitro
                        cell engineering system utilizing induced
                        mammalian cells for the preparation of
                        estradiol.</p>
                        <p><strong>[0008]</strong> In the method
                        described in the present invention, the cell
                        population used is derived from mammalian cells
                        through special induction methods, including
                        compound treatment, gene introduction, natural
                        substance induction, viral infection, radiation
                        induction, and long-term in vitro culture. These
                        methods induce the in vitro cultured mammalian
                        cells to acquire the ability to produce
                        estradiol. Since the secretion of estradiol in
                        this system simulates the biosynthetic process
                        in vivo, the resulting estrogen exhibits
                        complete species homology with the original
                        cells. The production of estradiol generates few
                        byproducts under mild conditions and poses
                        almost no harm to the environment.</p>
                        <p><strong>[0009]</strong> Specifically, the
                        method for preparing estradiol according to the
                        present invention is characterized by comprising
                        the following steps:</p>

                        the present invention is characterized by
                        comprising the following steps:</p>
                        <ol type="1">
                        <li><p>Isolated mammalian cells are subjected to
                        primary culture preparation using existing
                        techniques. The prepared cells are cultured in
                        DMEM medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum
                        under conditions of 37°C and 5% CO₂ until
                        reaching 10⁵ cells per culture flask.</p></li>
                        <li><p>MCA is added to the culture medium at a
                        final concentration of 1 μg/mL, and the
                        MCA-containing medium is replaced twice weekly.
                        After 1 week of MCA treatment, the cells are
                        maintained under standard culture conditions at
                        37°C and 5% CO₂.</p></li>
                        <li><p>After culturing for 3 months, germ
                        cell-like cells are observed in the culture.
                        These germ cell-like cells express germ cell
                        markers: Oct4, Nanos3, c-Kit, DAZL, and
                        Vasa.</p>
                        <p>In the present invention, sustained
                        expression of estradiol is detected in the
                        culture medium. Compared to untreated hBMDCs (E2
                        = 65 ± 14.8 pmol/L, n=6), MCA-induced hBMDCs (E2
                        = 3243 ± 947 pmol/L, n = 6) exhibit a 50-fold
                        increase in estradiol concentration (p &lt;
                        0.01), demonstrating significant differences.
                        After subculture, estradiol concentration
                        progressively increases with prolonged culture
                        time, peaking at approximately 10 days (up to
                        4500 pmol/L), then gradually decreasing while
                        maintaining relatively high levels.</p>
                        <p>In vivo, estradiol is synthesized by ovarian
                        follicles. In the present invention,
                        follicle-like structures are observed in
                        MCA-induced hBMDCs cultured in vitro. Oocyte
                        development requires estradiol
                        stimulation—without sufficient estradiol,
                        oocytes can only grow to a maximum of 25 μm. In
                        contrast, oocyte-like cells in MCA-induced
                        hBMDCs reach 40–50 μm in size, and
                        immunofluorescence confirms these large cells as
                        oocytes.</p>
                        <p>The present invention involves
                        follicle-related genes, including key estradiol
                        synthesis genes (STAR, p450arom, p450c17) and
                        follicle development-related gene (GDF9), which
                        are expressed in the culture.</p>
                        <p>By optimizing culture conditions, the
                        invention enhances estradiol production capacity
                        while reducing serum concentration in the
                        medium. These germ cell-like cells further
                        develop into early follicle-like structures and
                        oocyte-like cells.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The estradiol is isolated and purified
                        using existing methods.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>[0011]</strong> In the present
                        invention, said cell lines can be prepared by
                        inducing transformation of normal mammalian
                        cells through methods including chemical
                        induction, natural substance treatment, gene
                        introduction, radiation induction, viral
                        induction, or long-term passaging. The induced
                        cells, when cultured under high cell density
                        conditions, can spontaneously proliferate and
                        differentiate into cell populations including
                        pluripotent stem cell-like cells, granulosa
                        cell-like cells, primordial germ cell-like
                        cells, and oocyte-like cells. Continued culture
                        of these cells can further self-organize to form
                        follicle-like structures, with the produced
                        estrogen secreted into the culture medium, which
                        can then be enriched and purified using existing
                        techniques to obtain estradiol.</p>
                        <p><strong>[0012]</strong> The advantages of the

                        population is generated by special in vitro
                        induction of mammalian cells. Said cell

                        vitro conditions to continuously secrete
                        estrogen. The estrogen secretion in this system
                        completely simulates the biosynthetic process in
                        vivo, with few byproducts generated during
                        estradiol production, simple methodology, and
                        mild conditions that pose minimal environmental

                        primarily composed of human bone marrow
                        mesenchymal stem cells) were prepared by primary
                        culture using existing techniques (in this
                        example, bone marrow flushing and adherent
                        culture methods were employed). The prepared
                        cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing
                        15% fetal bovine serum under conditions of 37°C
                        and 5% CO₂ until reaching 10⁵ cells per culture
                        flask.</li>
                        <li>MCA was added to the culture medium at a
                        final concentration of 1 μg/mL, and the
                        MCA-containing medium was replaced twice weekly.
                        After 1 week of MCA treatment, the cells were
                        maintained under standard culture conditions
                        (37°C, 5% CO₂).</li>

                        cells were observed in the culture (as shown in
                        <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1A</a>). These germ
                        cell-like cells expressed germ cell markers:
                        Oct4, Nanos3, c-Kit, DAZL, and Vasa (as shown in
                        Figure 1B).</li>
                        <li>Sustained expression of estradiol was
                        detected in the culture medium. Compared to
                        untreated hBMDCs (E2 = 65 ± 14.8 pmol/L, n = 6),
                        MCA-induced hBMDCs (E2 = 3243 ± 947 pmol/L, n =
                        6) exhibited a 50-fold increase in estradiol
                        concentration (p &lt; 0.01), demonstrating
                        significant differences (as shown in <a
                        href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>). After subculture,
                        estradiol concentration progressively increased
                        with prolonged culture time, peaking at
                        approximately 10 days (up to 4500 pmol/L), then
                        gradually decreasing while maintaining
                        relatively high levels (as shown in Figure
                        3).</li>
                        <li>In vivo, estradiol is synthesized by ovarian
                        follicles. In this invention, follicle-like
                        structures were observed in MCA-induced hBMDCs
                        cultured in vitro (as shown in <a
                        href="#Figure4">Figures 4A-E</a>), providing
                        cellular support for estrogen production. Oocyte
                        development requires estradiol
                        stimulation—without sufficient estradiol,
                        oocytes can only grow to a maximum of 25 μm. In
                        contrast, oocyte-like cells in MCA-induced
                        hBMDCs reached 40–50 μm in size (as shown in <a
                        href="#Figure4">Figures 4I-G</a>), and
                        immunofluorescence confirmed these large cells
                        as oocytes (as shown in <a

                        <li>0% Confluence: No cells attached (empty
                        flask).</li>
                        <li>50% Confluence: Half the surface covered by
                        cells.</li>
                        <li>70–80% Confluence: Cells are nearly touching
                        but not overcrowded (optimal for passaging,
                        cells in their logarithmic growth phase,
                        prevents contact inhibition).</li>
                        <li>100% Confluence: Cells fully cover the
                        surface, risking stress and
                        differentiation.</li>

                        <ol type="1">
                        <li>Remove Old Medium: Aspirate the spent
                        culture medium (contains waste products).</li>
                        <li>Wash Cells: Gently rinse with PBS (phosphate
                        buffered saline) to remove dead
                        cells/debris.</li>
                        <li>Detach Cells: Add a digestive enzyme (e.g.,
                        trypsin) to lift adherent cells from the flask
                        surface.</li>
