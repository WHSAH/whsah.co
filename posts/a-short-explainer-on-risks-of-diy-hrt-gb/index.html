                        id="general-risks-of-hrt">General Risks of
                        HRT</h2>
                        <p>There are minor risks associated with HRT,
                        such as a tiny increase in blood clots for E (in
                        line with cis women) or polycythaemia for T. The
                        latter can be tested for; it is a risk factor
                        rather than its own illness (and can be fixed by
                        donating blood or lowering dose). HRT itself
                        does not cause serious harm when appropriate
                        medications + doses are used.</p>
                        <p>Bad levels can increase the above risks,
                        cause osteoporosis, mental health issues and
                        other problems associated with menopause.
                        Unfortunately, not all guidelines / doctors are
                        good at giving patients optimal levels. Blood
                        tests allow you to know your levels and react
                        accordingly to protect your health.</p>
                        <h2 data-number="3"
                        id="prescribed-hrt-in-gb">Prescribed HRT in
                        GB</h2>
                        <p>If wishing to feminise, patches, pills and
                        gel are the only options for oestrogen. You may
                        also be prescribed GnRH agonists or other
                        blockers. If wishing to masculinise, injections
                        (Sustanon or Nebido; TE very rarely, often only
                        when allergies apply) and gel are the only
                        options given.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to HRT most doctors just look
                        at a blood test result and compare your results
                        to official guidelines. There is nothing special
                        about what they do, they are simply comparing
                        numbers.</p>
                        <p>If taking oestrogen, just before your next
                        dose your E should be between 370–740 pmol/l
                        (100–200 pg/mL), T below 1.8 nmol/L (50 ng/dL).
                        If taking testosterone, you should be between
                        10–25 nmol/L (300–750 ng/dL) with your FBC in
                        male range.</p>
                        <h2 data-number="4" id="dodgy-products">Dodgy
                        Products</h2>
                        <p>Many sites just resell pharmaceutical
                        products- other than a doctor signing off on it
                        there is no difference between what’s inside
                        medication bought from a pharmacy overseas and
                        what you’d get from your local pharmacy in GB.
                        If you are using sites known to be good the risk
                        is practically zero: these sites rely on repeat
                        customers!</p>
                        <p>The community has a vested interest in
                        reviewing sources as we want to keep each other
                        safe.</p>
                        <p>You can stay safe using homebrew medications
                        (usually injections, spray, gel) by using peer
                        reviewed sources. People with experience
                        evaluating homebrewing procedures can confirm
                        whether a production method has any significant
                        safety oversights. Trusted sources have lab
                        tests confirming that there is only the listed
                        active ingredient inside the product.</p>
                        <p>For T injections specifically: many sites
                        listing a pharma resell are lying, because
                        people will pay more for a product that looks
                        like a resell instead of homebrew.</p>
                        <p>If you are using a source that is well
                        reviewed and well known you are very unlikely to
                        encounter any issues. Substituting T for
                        something else would lose customers; the market
                        for T is extremely big so there are dozens of
                        competitors.</p>
                        <p>There is no motivation for a seller with a
                        good track record to substitute any product for
                        something dangerous. They would be spending
                        money to ruin their income.</p>
