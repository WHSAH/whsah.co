                The direct conversion of progesterone to potent
                androgens like DHT is rare in healthy individuals, as
                the “backdoor pathway” for androgen synthesis is not
                significant in humans, unlike in some animals.
                Exceptions occur in conditions like non-classic
                congenital adrenal hyperplasia (ncCAH), where enzyme
                deficiencies disrupt hormone metabolism, or during fetal
                male development. Androgenic symptoms attributed to
                progesterone are more likely due to its indirect effects
                on adrenal regulation, insulin sensitivity, and natural
                variations in the expression of key enzymes.
                Progesterone is primarily metabolized into
                non-androgenic compounds, such as allopregnanolone and
                corticosteroids, with only minimal conversion to DHT
                except under specific conditions. In individuals with
                ncCAH, progesterone supplementation can exacerbate
                hyperandrogenism due to enzyme deficiencies, which
                diverts hormone synthesis toward androgens, or further
                dysregulate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in
                people with PCOS-like metabolic disorders. Progesterone
                also interacts in complex ways with the HPA axis and
                insulin signaling, and high non-oral doses could disrupt
                hormonal and metabolic balances, potentially causing
                symptoms mistaken for androgenic activity. Diagnosis of
                ncCAH and PCOS-like syndrome has improved with
                biomarkers like 21-deoxycortisol and 11-oxygenated
                androgens, and treatment in the context of gender
                affirming hormonal therapy is relatively simple and
                involves discontinuing progesterone, using
                anti-androgens (e.g., dutasteride), or supervised
                low-dose glucocorticoid therapy.

                <p>The direct conversion of progesterone to DHT and
                other potent androgens is very rare in healthy
                individuals. Unlike in rodents and Tammar wallabies, the
                “backdoor pathway” for androgen synthesis does not occur
                to any significant extent in humans, even during
                progesterone supplementation. Exceptions to this rule
                are limited to specific conditions, such as non-classic
                congenital adrenal hyperplasia (ncCAH), where enzymatic
                deficiencies disrupt hormone metabolism, and during
                fetal development of male primary sexual
                characteristics. Claims of androgenic symptoms caused by
                progesterone are more adequately explained by its
                complex indirect relationship with adrenal regulation,
                insulin sensitivity, and existing variations in the
                expression levels of key enzymes across individuals.</p>

                class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why is it
                mostly a myth</h3>
                <p>Of the many steps necessary for the conversion of
                progesterone to DHT, several of the enzymes catalyzing
                each of those steps have very low affinities and
                catalytic efficiencies for progesterone and its
                derivatives. Instead, progesterone is quickly picked up
                by enzymes with much better affinity and preferentially
                flows towards the biosynthesis of allopregnanolone,
                responsible for progesterone’s sedative effects, various
                corticosteroids like aldosterone, or is extensively
                metabolized and eliminated by the adipose, liver, and
                kidneys. For the tiny amount that avoids this fate,
                there are several additional steps to go through before
                reaching DHT. Along the way, progesterone derivatives
                encounter similar conditions, namely low enzyme
                affinities, preferred redirections away from DHT, and
                the possibility of being metabolized, conjugated, and
                eliminated by the body. See <a href="#Figure1">Figure
                1</a> for a graphical summary.</p>
                <p>In short, the transformation of progesterone into DHT
                is a lengthy and inefficient process not favored by the
                body, except under specific conditions.</p>

                <p>One situation in which progesterone supplementation
                could lead to androgenic symptoms, including those
                caused by DHT, is in the presence of congenital adrenal
                hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a group of genetic disorders
                that disrupt steroid hormone production in the adrenal
                glands. The classical form is rare, often
                life-threatening, and typically detected in newborns. In
                contrast, the nonclassical form (ncCAH) is more common
                with an incidence rate of at least 1 in 1,000 and
                potentially as high as 1 in 200 and frequently goes
                undiagnosed for years, especially in milder cases. ncCAH
                can cause symptoms like premature puberty, excessive
                hair growth, acne, or irregular periods in people with
                ovaries, often overlapping with conditions like
                polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In cis men, symptoms
                may be subtle or overlooked, as they may align with
                typical gender expectations. Trans feminine individuals
                may also face challenges, as symptoms of poor
                feminization despite hormone replacement therapy are
                often dismissed or misunderstood due to lack of
                awareness and biases in healthcare.</p>
                <p>Both forms of CAH are caused by enzyme deficiencies,
                most commonly 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). This
                impairs the usual conversion of progesterone and related
                hormones into cortisol and aldosterone, and causes an
                accumulation and spillover into pathways that produce
                androgens, often resulting in symptoms of
                hyperandrogenism. Progesterone supplementation in
                individuals with ncCAH could worsen this imbalance,
                potentially turning a mild or asymptomatic case into one
                with clinically significant androgenic symptoms.</p>
                <p>Finally, progesterone has a complex relationship with
                the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and
                insulin signaling, which regulate stress responses,
                immune function, salt and water balance, and glucose
                metabolism. It is a potent antimineralocorticoid and
                modulator of insulin and prolactin secretion, it rapidly
                accumulates in tissues, and is extensively metabolized
                into various steroid derivatives in the liver, adrenals,
                and adipose tissue, each with its own regulatory
                effects. Consequently, using progesterone non-orally
                (e.g., rectally or via intramuscular injection)
                continuously and in large doses carries the risk of
                disrupting hormonal and metabolic balances, even in
                individuals without enzymatic deficiencies. This
                disruption could lead to symptoms that may be mistakenly
                interpreted as signs of androgenic activity, but given
                the role of insulin in modulating adrenal response,
                androgen steroidogenic pathways, and the downstream
                inhibition of aromatase, progesterone might indirectly
                cause symptoms of PCOS-like hyperandrogenicity.</p>
                <p>Emerging evidence suggests that a PCOS-like condition
                may exist in individuals without ovarian tissue,
                characterized by metabolic and hormonal abnormalities
                similar to those seen in ovarian PCOS, such as insulin
                resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and
                early-onset androgenetic alopecia (AGA). This condition
                is particularly prevalent in first-degree relatives of
                individuals with ovarian PCOS, indicating a potential
                genetic component. Early-onset AGA, defined as hair loss
                before the age of 35, has been proposed as a clinical
                marker of this condition, as it is frequently observed
                in families with a history of ovarian PCOS. Individuals
                without ovarian tissue who exhibit this condition often
                show elevated levels of LH, DHEA-S, 17OH-P, and
                prolactin, along with reduced levels of SHBG and FSH.
                Insulin resistance is a key feature, with studies
                showing that individuals with early-onset AGA and
                hormonal abnormalities similar to ovarian PCOS exhibit
                higher insulin resistance compared to those without such
                hormonal changes. While hyperandrogenism is a hallmark
                of ovarian PCOS, those without ovarian tissue and with
                this condition often have normal or even subnormal
                testosterone levels, suggesting that the clinical signs
                of hyperandrogenism, such as AGA, may result from the
                conversion of weaker androgens like DHEA-S into more
                potent forms in peripheral tissues.</p>

                <p>While the diagnosis of ncCAH caused by 21OHD used to
                be difficult, recent research found 21-deoxycortisol to
                be a biomarker offering near-perfect diagnostic accuracy
                when using the more accurate and precise LC-MS/MS assay
                instead of immunoassays. Cases of ncCAH caused by 11OHD,
                fortunately much rarer, are likely to cause additional
                difficulties and require not only steroid panels but
                in-depth genetic analysis. PCOS-like hyperandrogenicity
                may indicate the presence of hyperinsulinemia, incipient
                insulin resistance, or a non-ovarian PCOS-like
                condition, in which case a glucose resistance test and
                possibly an 11-oxygenated androgen panel could be
                recommended.</p>

                done</h3>
                <p>Fortunately, interventions are available and
                relatively straightforward. In all cases, discontinuing
                progesterone supplementation is strongly recommended.
                For individuals who were previously asymptomatic, this
                step alone is often sufficient. For those who started
                progesterone to address unsatisfactory feminization
                outcomes and experienced a significant worsening of
                androgenic symptoms such as acne, increased body hair,
                and male pattern hair loss. For those without access to
                specialized care, dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) is the
                preferred treatment. If dutasteride is unavailable,
                bicalutamide (25-50 mg/day) or finasteride (1 mg/day)
                can serve as alternative options. In the very rare case
                of 11-hydroxylase deficiency, 5α-reductase inhibitors
                should be avoided. For individuals with access to
                specialized healthcare, we recommend seeking a formal
                diagnosis for potential adrenal disorders, which may
                lead to low-dose glucocorticoid therapy under the
                supervision of a medical professional, or for a
                PCOS-like disorder in which case metformin or inositol
                supplementation may be recommended. We strongly
                discourage attempting glucocorticoid therapy without
                proper medical oversight, as improper use, including at
                low doses and especially during long-term use, can lead
                to serious side effects, including immune suppression,
                bone density loss, metabolic disturbances, and dangers
                associated with abrupt discontinuation.</p>

                kinetics</h3>
                <p>Let’s go down the rabbit hole of enzyme kinetics.
                This is sure to get confusing, but refer to <a
                href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a> for a graphical, yet
                complete qualitative summary of all the information
                presented in the following sections, and <a
                href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> for additional quantitative
                details. The takeaway should be that during the
                biosynthesis of androgens the body conspires in various
                ways to prevent the conversion of progesterone into
                DHT.</p>
                <p>In other words the conversion of progesterone to DHT
                is highly inefficient, and understanding enzyme affinity
                is key to explaining why. Affinity is often described
                using the Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>M</sub>),
                which represents the substrate concentration at which
                the reaction rate is half of the maximum rate
                (V<sub>max</sub>). K<sub>M</sub> has two key
                interpretations: (1) it reflects binding affinity, where
                a lower K<sub>M</sub> means tighter substrate binding,
                and (2) it partially indicates catalytic efficiency
                (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>), where a low
                K<sub>M</sub> allows high reaction rates even at low
                substrate concentrations. However, affinity is not the
                same as efficacy. An enzyme may bind a substrate tightly
                (high affinity) but convert it poorly (low efficacy), or
                vice versa. Since data for k<sub>cat</sub> is less
                readily available than for K<sub>M</sub>, we will mainly
                focus on the latter, although a complete discussion
                would have to include k<sub>cat</sub> (the turnover
                number) as well.</p>

                <p>For the vast majority of us, PROG doesn’t make it to
                17OH-P, the entry point to the backdoor pathway, and one
                of the entry point to the Δ<sup>4</sup> frontdoor
                pathway to androgen biosynthesis. Those are the only two
                ways through which PROG could eventually be converted to
                DHT. Instead, it gets quickly funneled into
                mineralocorticoid biosynthesis by 21-hydroxylase, or
                towards the synthesis of allopregnanolone by
                5α-reductase <span class="citation"

                that 5α-reductase type 2 is strongly expressed in the

                PROG is taken orally and goes through first-pass
                metabolism. The strength of this redirection comes from
                the fact that the enzyme which catalyzes the reaction
                from PROG to 17OH-P, 17α-hydroxylase (encoded by
                CYP17A1), has a very low affinity for PROG compared to
                other immediate catalysts, roughly 10 times less than
                that of 21-hydroxylase and 30 times less than that of

                <p>There is still a small amount that does make it to

                <li>continue along the Δ<sup>4</sup> frontdoor pathway
                by being converted to androstenedione (A4) by
                17,20-lyase (also encoded by CYP17A1 but requiring
                additional cofactors),</li>
                <li>enter the backdoor pathway by being converted into
                17OH-DHP by 5α-reductase,</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The affinity of 21-hydroxylase for PROG is

                21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) or 11-hydroxylase
                deficiency (11OHD), only a minute amount of 17OH-P
                derived directly from PROG becomes either

                <p>Given the terrible affinity of 17α-hydroxylase for
                PROG, the main contributor to the levels of 17OH-P
                necessary for glucocorticoid biosynthesis is
                17α-hydroxypregnenolone (17OH-PREG) derived from
                pregnenolone (PREG). 17OH-PREG is incidentally the main
                precursor to all androgens through the Δ<sup>5</sup>
                frontdoor pathway. The conversion of 17OH-PREG into
                17OH-P (towards either the glucocorticoid pathways or
                the backdoor pathway) is driven by HSD3B1/HSD3B2, and
                into DHEA along the Δ<sup>5</sup> frondoor pathway by
                17,20-lyase. The affinity of 17α-hydroxylase for PREG is
                10 to 20 times greater than its affinity for PROG, and
                the affinity of 17,20-lyase for 17OH-PREG is 10 to 100
                times greater than that of HSD3B1/HSD3B2.</p>

                <p>At this point, only a minuscule amount has made it to
                17OH-DHP, where it can be converted to
                17α-hydroxy-allopregnanolone (17OH-ALLOPREG) by certain
                aldo reductases and cross over through the backdoor
                pathway into androsterone (AST). The last steps are

                <ul>

                <p>The steps from AST to 5α-dione and from 3α-diol to

                <p>Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a
                rare and life-threatening disorder usually detected in
                newborns using a Gurthie test and occurs in 1 in 10,000
                to 1 in 20,000 live births. On the other hand,
                nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (ncCAH) is
                relatively common and is estimate to occur in at least 1

                hyperandrogenism and hirsutism, or persistent acne.

                anxiety, and gender dysphoria.</p>
                <p>In CAH and ncCAH caused by 21-hyroxylase deficiency
                (21OHP), mutations in the gene CYP21A2 coding for the
                enzyme 21-hydroxylase lead to a partial reduction
                (ncCAH) or a complete reduction (CAH) of the efficiency
                with which progesterone (PROG) is metabolized into
                aldosterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OH-P) into
                cortisol. Impaired aldosterone and cortisol synthesis
                lead to the loss of negative feedback on the
                hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and therefore to the
                stimulation of ACTH secretion and eventually to adrenal
                overactivity and hyperplasia. The resulting increase in
                the synthesis of corticosteroid precursors by overactive
                adrenals in the absence of efficient catalysis by
                21-hydroxylase causes accumulation of high levels of
                PROG and 17OH-P and to the deflection of catalysis
                towards pathways that are usually less favored, all of
                which increase the total pool of androgens in one way or
                another and can lead to symptoms of
                hyperandrogenism.</p>

                <p>In the context of 21OHD, progesterone supplementation
                can cause progesterone pooling, as it cannot enter the
                mineralocorticoid pathways as readily or at all in the
                classical case. This pooling can divert progesterone
                into several metabolic pathways, each with significant
                consequences:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>Δ<sup>5</sup> pathway spillover: Progesterone may
                accumulate distally as pregnenolone, leading to
                spillover into the Δ<sup>5</sup> frontdoor pathway. This
                can generate large amounts of DHEA-S released in
                systemic circulation, potentially enhancing the
                intracrine synthesis of strong androgens in peripheral
                tissues as modulated by individual enzymatic expression
                levels. Incidentally, the obligate generation of the
                intermediate 17OH-PREG may exacerbate the next two
                points since it is a precursor of 17OH-P.</li>
                <li>Δ<sup>4</sup> and backdoor pathways spillover:
                Despite 17α-hydroxylase’s relatively low affinity for
                progesterone, spillover into the Δ<sup>4</sup> frontdoor
                and backdoor pathways remains possible. In fact,
                17α-hydroxylase’s catalytic efficiency
                (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) for progesterone is of a
                similar order of magnitude as for pregnenolone <span

                17OH-P could exacerbate hyperandrogenic symptoms typical
                of 21OHD. Additionally, progesterone’s high affinity for
                5α-reductase may lead to its conversion into
                allopregnanolone, potentially causing
                benzodiazepine-like sedative effects.</li>
                <li>11-oxygenated androgen pathway: A less well-known
                pathway involves the initial 11-hydroxylation of
                progesterone by CYP11B1/2 (though affinity and efficacy
                data for CYP11B and progesterone are lacking). This
                could transform progesterone into
                11β-hydroxyprogesterone (11OH-P), which may then be
                17α-hydroxylated into 21DF. From there, it could enter

                <p>Fortunately, interventions are available and
                relatively straightforward. Discontinuing progesterone
                supplementation is strongly recommended. For individuals
                who were previously asymptomatic, this step alone is
                often sufficient. For those who started progesterone to
                address unsatisfactory feminization outcomes and
                subsequently experienced worsening androgenic symptoms
                (e.g., acne, increased body hair, or male pattern hair
                loss). For those without access to specialized care,
                dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) is the preferred treatment. If
                dutasteride is unavailable, bicalutamide (25-50 mg/day)
                or finasteride (1 mg/day) can serve as alternatives. For
                individuals with access to specialized healthcare, we
                recommend seeking a formal diagnosis for potential
                adrenal disorders, which may lead to low-dose

                11OHD is caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene, which
                encodes the enzyme mainly responsible for converting
                11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone
                (DOC) to corticosterone, P4 to 11β-hydroxyprogesterone,
                17OH-P to 21-deoxycortisol, and also A4 and T into their
                11-oxygenated androgen counterparts 11OH-A4 and 11OH-T.
                The deficiency leads to a buildup of precursor steroids,
                including DOC, which has mineralocorticoid activity, and
                adrenal androgens. The severity with which mutations in
                CYP11B1 impair the efficacy of its 11β-hydroxylase
                action gives rise to a spectrum of clinical
                manifestations ranging from the more severe classic form
                (c11OHD) to milder nonclassical form (nc11OHD) <span

                <p>Classic 11OHD is characterized by hypertension,
                ambiguous genitalia in females, and hyperandrogenism in
                both sexes. Hypertension, a hallmark of c11OHD, results
                from the accumulation of DOC, which activates the
                mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to sodium retention
                and volume expansion. This is a key feature that
                distinguishes 11OHD from 21OHD, which typically presents
                with salt-wasting due to aldosterone deficiency <span

                Females with c11OHD are often diagnosed at birth due to
                ambiguous genitalia, while males may present later in
                childhood with signs of precocious pseudopuberty,
                accelerated growth, and advanced bone age. Untreated
                c11OHD can lead to short adult height often falling 2-3
                standard deviations or more below the population mean

                <p>Non-classical 11OHD is a milder form of the disorder,
                with symptoms typically appearing later in childhood or
                adolescence. Unlike c11OHD, nc11OHD does not present
                with ambiguous genitalia or hypertension, making it
                harder to diagnose. Patients may exhibit premature
                pubarche, hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities, and
                infertility, all symptoms that overlap with ncCAH due to
                21OHD <span class="citation"

                The incidence of nc11OHD is less well-defined, but it is
                thought to be rarer than the classic form. Some cases
                may be asymptomatic or present with very mild symptoms,
                escaping clinical attention unless steroid profiling or
                genetic testing is performed <span class="citation"

                The milder phenotype in nc11OHD is attributed to
                residual enzyme activity, with some mutations retaining
                5-10% of normal function and thus partial cortisol
                synthesis and less severe androgen excess <span

                However, it remains unclear whether hyperandrogenism in
                this condition could partially arise from backdoor
                androgen conversion. On one hand, the absence of
                elevated 17OH-P might suggest that such conversion is
                not occurring. On the other hand, the presence of
                elevated A4 points to a spillover effect into the
                Δ<sup>4</sup> pathway. Given that 17OH-P serves as an
                entry point for both pathways, it is plausible that this
                spillover could extend to the backdoor pathway as well.
                The 11-deoxycortisol/cortisol ratio is a key diagnostic
                marker, with values &gt;2.2 indicating n11OHD, values
                &lt;1.5 suggesting nc11OHD, and values &lt;0.1
                indicating absence of 11OHD, reaching 100% specificity

                ACTH stimulation tests and genetic testing for CYP11B1
                mutations are essential for confirming the diagnosis and
                differentiating 11OHD from other forms of CAH. Like
                21OHD, treatment for both c- and nc11OHD involves
                glucocorticoid replacement to suppress ACTH-driven
                androgen production and monitoring to avoid
                over-replacement, which can exacerbate growth impairment

                While speculative, this upregulation could enhance
                activity through the 5α-dione pathway and increase the
                direct conversion of adrenal precursors into DHT,
                potentially exacerbating androgenic symptoms.</p>
                <p>Out of caution, dutasteride and finasteride might be
                contraindicated in these cases, as blocking 5α-reductase
                could further exacerbate DOC and 11-deoxycortisol
                accumulation, potentially leading to metabolic
                complications such as hypertension or electrolyte
                imbalances. In such scenarios, bicalutamide may be a

                Diagnosing PCOS is challenging due to varying clinical
                presentations and differing diagnostic criteria (NIH,
                Rotterdam-ESHRE/ASRM, AES), which focus on
                hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction but often
                overlook metabolic abnormalities, leading to

                <p>At the core of PCOS pathophysiology are two
                interconnected factors which reinforce each others:
                hyperandrogenism and IR-induced hyperinsulinaemia. This
                link exists due to the fact that adrenal cells, ovarian
                theca cells, and ovarian granulosa cells (the principal
                contributors to steroid biosynthesis in people with
                ovaries) retain sensitivity to insulin signalling while
                the rest of the body grows increasingly
                insulin-resistant, further exacerbating compensatory
                hyperinsulinaemia.</p>
                <p>In the following sections we will spend a significant
                amount of time reviewing this relationship as it will
                prove to be the key to understanding a potentially
                important link between progesterone and androgenic
                symptoms.</p>

                Hyperinsulinaemia as the central driver of steroidogenic

                <p>The interplay between hyperinsulinemia and
                hyperandrogenism in PCOS is rooted in insulin’s ability
                to directly amplify adrenal and ovarian steroidogenesis.
                Early studies demonstrated that hyperinsulinemia
                potentiates ACTH-stimulated adrenal androgen production,
                with hyperandrogenic people with PCOS showing elevated
                17OH-PREG, 17OH-P, and DHEA during hyperinsulinemic
                clamps <span class="citation"

                This effect is mechanistically mirrored in adrenal
                cells, where insulin and IGF-I upregulate CYP17A1 and
                HSD3B2 mRNA (key enzymes for androgen synthesis)
                independently of ACTH or cAMP <span class="citation"

                Moreover, people with PCOS and elevated DHEA-S exhibit
                greater net maximal and overall responses of DHEA and A4
                to ACTH stimulation compared to controls, but no

                line with these results, hyperinsulinemia in
                hyperandrogenic people with PCOS amplifies
                ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroidogenesis, increasing
                17OH-PREG and 17OH-P levels and urinary C19 and C21

                indicating that some of those steroidogenesis
                alterations are likely the result of distal genetic and

                <p>One of the clearest indicators of the adrenal glands’
                contribution to hyperandrogenism in PCOS is the finding

                In a model of PCOS adipocytes, insulin induces AKR1C3

                Analysis of urinary metabolites in people with PCOS

                previous results showing elevated 11-oxygenated

                conversion of androgens into their 11-hydroxy
                derivatives, and enhancement of HSD11B2 and
                downregulation of HSD11B1 implies that the
                transformation of 11-hydroxy androgens into 11-keto is
                subsequently enhanced. Further exacerbation of the
                synthesis of the two most potent 11-oxygenated androgens

                Insulin resistance is a key feature, with studies
                showing that people with early-onset AGA and hormonal
                abnormalities similar to PCOS exhibit higher insulin
                resistance compared to those without such hormonal
                changes. Lower SHBG levels have been associated with
                impaired glucose metabolism and may serve as a marker
                for insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in these
                people. While hyperandrogenism is a hallmark of ovarian

                explored rare scenarios where this might occur, such as

                an underlying, undiagnosed, or asymptomatic enzymatic

                reports of androgenic symptoms following progesterone
                use remain relatively common and these experiences are
                frequently shared in online trans spaces. However, there

                nothing more than coincidental factors and
                misattributions by those experiencing them. In this

                in combination, for 21 days. Plasma insulin responses
                during glucose tolerance tests were elevated in both
                pregnant and steroid-treated rats, with estradiol
                lowering post-challenge glucose levels. Progesterone
                increased insulin secretion without significantly
                affecting glucose levels, indicating that chronic
                exposure to estradiol and progesterone enhances insulin
                secretion and islet hypertrophy <span class="citation"

                for 15 days with 5 mg progesterone (HED of 320 mg/day)
                and 5 µg estradiol exhibited islets with enhanced
                insulin response of around 60% at 20 mmol/L of glucose
                or at 6 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L glucose and theophylline (a
                cAMP enhancer), without changes in adenylate cyclase
                activity. In vitro, islets cultured with 10 µg/ml
                progesterone and 1 µg/ml estradiol for 20 hours also
                showed increased insulin secretion, particularly with
                glucose and theophylline. These findings suggest that
                progesterone and estradiol enhance insulin secretion
                directly, independent of adenylate cyclase activation,

                <p>Further investigations into the combined effects of
                progesterone and estradiol revealed that female rats
                receiving daily subcutaneous injections of progesterone
                (2.5 mg/day for 14 days, then 5 mg/day for 7 days, HED
                of 160 mg/day then 320 mg/day) and estradiol in a 1:1000
                ratio exhibited suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis and
                increased liver glycogen deposition. Plasma insulin
                levels were significantly elevated in all groups (~50%
                in progesterone or estradiol groups, and ~100% in
                progesterone + estradiol group), suggesting that
                estradiol and progesterone, particularly in combination,
                promote insulin-like effects on liver carbohydrate
                metabolism, enhancing glycogen storage and reducing
                glucose production, without inducing insulin resistance

                <p>In human studies, daily intramuscular progesterone
                administration (4 subjects received 300 mg/day, 3
                subjects received 400 mg/day) over six days was used to
                reach urinary pregnanediol levels comparable to late
                pregnancy. Progesterone significantly increased fasting
                plasma insulin levels and enhanced insulin responses
                during oral glucose and intravenous tolbutamide (an
                insulin secretion stimulator) tolerance tests, without
                altering fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids,
                cortisol, or growth hormone (GH) levels. These changes
                mirrored the hyperinsulinemia observed in late
                pregnancy, suggesting that progesterone contributes to
                the augmented plasma insulin response seen during
                gestation, likely as a compensatory mechanism to
                peripheral insulin resistance <span class="citation"

                Similarly, fifteen normal non-diabetic adults receiving
                daily intramuscular progesterone (300–400 mg) for 3–5
                days showed significantly increased plasma insulin
                responses during oral glucose and intravenous arginine
                (a GH secretion stimulator) tests, while plasma glucose
                increments during arginine infusion were reduced.
                Progesterone also blunted peak GH responses to glucose,
                insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and arginine in most
                subjects, though two female subjects showed paradoxical
                increases in GH. These findings suggest that
                progesterone contributes to the suppression of pituitary
                GH release and hyperinsulinemia observed in late
                pregnancy, likely through central mechanisms rather than
                direct pituitary effects <span class="citation"

                <p>The time-dependent modulation of insulin sensitivity
                by progesterone was further explored using a
                euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in ovariectomized
                rats. Subcutaneous administration of progesterone and
                estradiol every 12 hours for 20 days to mimic pregnancy
                hormone levels indicated that progesterone increased
                insulin sensitivity at high concentrations, while
                estradiol enhanced sensitivity at low levels but reduced
                it at high concentrations. These results suggest that
                estradiol improves insulin sensitivity early in
                pregnancy, whereas progesterone counteracts this effect
                later, contributing to the insulin resistance observed
                in late pregnancy, possibly as a way to maintain glucose
                homeostasis during gestation <span class="citation"

                <p>At the cellular level, a novel mechanism involving
                the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1)
                was identified. In Hep3B cells, PGRMC1 activation
                increased cAMP levels, leading to the induction of
                phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression and
                enhanced gluconeogenesis. Progesterone similarly
                upregulated PGRMC1, cAMP, and PEPCK, increasing glucose
                production in hepatocytes. In vivo, progesterone
                suppressed gluconeogenesis under normal conditions by
                promoting insulin secretion but increased blood glucose
                via gluconeogenesis in insulin-deficient and
                insulin-resistant states. These findings suggest that
                PGRMC1-mediated gluconeogenesis exacerbates
                hyperglycemia in diabetes <span class="citation"

                Furthermore, it was found that progesterone receptor
                knockout (PR−/−) mice exhibit improved glucose
                homeostasis due to enhanced β-cell proliferation and
                insulin secretion. Female PR−/− mice showed lower
                fasting glycemia and higher insulin levels during
                glucose tolerance tests compared to wild-type (PR+/+)
                mice. Pancreatic islets from PR−/− mice were larger and
                secreted more insulin, attributed to an increase in
                β-cell mass driven by elevated β-cell proliferation,
                rather than reduced apoptosis. In contrast, progesterone
                treatment in diabetic db/db mice accelerated diabetes
                progression, while the progesterone receptor antagonist

                <p>In summary, progesterone exerts complex,
                time-dependent effects on insulin secretion,
                sensitivity, and glucose metabolism. It enhances
                compensatory insulin responses and β-cell function,
                which may contribute to hyperinsulinemia and, over time,
                the development or exacerbation of insulin resistance
                and metabolic dysregulation in susceptible individuals
                including those with insulin deficiency,
                asymptomatic/incipient insulin resistance, prediabetes,

                <p>Integrating previous findings on progesterone and
                PCOS, chronic progesterone supplementation may carry
                risks and further complications possibly impacting
                transition outcomes which, as far as I know, have be

                This could lead to the development or exacerbation of
                androgenic symptoms by enhancing steroid biosynthetic
                pathways in the adrenals with a focus on 11-oxygenated
                androgens, and thus despite suppression of the HPG axis

                active organs but extending beyond the ovaries and
                adrenals due to the absence of IR. This effect could
                occur through mechanisms ressembling those observed in
                PCOS in tissues with overlapping expression of key
                enzymes. For example, in tissues like the skin,
                follicles, and adipose, this process might upregulate
                5α-reductase and AKR1C3 both implicated in the synthesis
                of all strong androgens, and alter the MYO:DCI ratio,
                thus upregulating epimerase activity and ultimately
                resulting in some degree of aromatase inhibition.</li>

                <p>These inferences, however, are likely premature for
                several reasons. First, PCOS is a highly complex
                syndrome, and the link between IR and hyperandrogenism
                may depend on additional factors, such as distal genetic
                and metabolic components. Second, the role of

                class="header-section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The relationship between progesterone, DHT, and the
                backdoor pathway is complex and context-dependent. The
                myth of progesterone’s direct androgenic effects is
                largely unfounded because its conversion into DHT is
                negligeable in healthy individuals. On the other hand,
                specific conditions such as ncCAH and PCOS can disrupt
                normal steroidogenesis, leading to metabolic and
                hormonal dysregulation and to hyperandrogenism and can
                occur in the transgender population as much as in any
                other. Progesterone supplementation may exacerbate these
                conditions by causing elevation and accumulation of
                steroid precursors, or by its induction of
                hyperinsulinemia. While progesterone’s role in androgen
                synthesis is complicated by its interactions with the
                HPA axis and insulin sensitivity, its potential to exert
                an indirect influence on androgenic symptoms, especially
                in individuals with underlying metabolic or endocrine
                vulnerabilities, cannot be readily dismissed. Future
                research should focus on clarifying these mechanisms to
                optimize therapeutic strategies and improve transition
                outcomes in clinical and GAHT settings.</p>
