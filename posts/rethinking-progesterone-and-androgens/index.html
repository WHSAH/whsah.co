                The direct conversion of progesterone to potent
                androgens like DHT is rare in healthy individuals, as
                the “backdoor pathway” for androgen synthesis is not
                significant in humans, unlike in some animals.
                Exceptions occur in conditions like non-classic
                congenital adrenal hyperplasia (ncCAH), where enzyme
                deficiencies disrupt hormone metabolism, or during fetal
                male development. Androgenic symptoms attributed to
                progesterone are more likely due to its indirect effects
                on adrenal regulation, insulin sensitivity, and natural
                variations in the expression of key enzymes.
                Progesterone is primarily metabolized into
                non-androgenic compounds, such as allopregnanolone and
                corticosteroids, with only minimal conversion to DHT
                except under specific conditions. In individuals with
                ncCAH, progesterone supplementation can exacerbate
                hyperandrogenism due to enzyme deficiencies, which
                diverts hormone synthesis toward androgens, or further
                dysregulate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in
                people with PCOS-like metabolic disorders. Progesterone
                also interacts in complex ways with the HPA axis and
                insulin signaling, and high non-oral doses could disrupt
                hormonal and metabolic balances, potentially causing
                symptoms mistaken for androgenic activity. Diagnosis of
                ncCAH and PCOS-like syndrome has improved with
                biomarkers like 21-deoxycortisol and 11-oxygenated
                androgens, and treatment in the context of gender
                affirming hormonal therapy is relatively simple and
                involves discontinuing progesterone, using
                anti-androgens (e.g., dutasteride), or supervised
                low-dose glucocorticoid therapy.

                class="header-section-number">1</span> Summary</h2>
                <p>The direct conversion of progesterone to DHT and
                other potent androgens is very rare in healthy
                individuals. Unlike in rodents and Tammar wallabies, the
                “backdoor pathway” for androgen synthesis does not occur
                to any significant extent in humans, even during
                progesterone supplementation. Exceptions to this rule
                are limited to specific conditions, such as non-classic
                congenital adrenal hyperplasia (ncCAH), where enzymatic
                deficiencies disrupt hormone metabolism, and during
                fetal development of male primary sexual
                characteristics. Claims of androgenic symptoms caused by
                progesterone are more adequately explained by its
                complex indirect relationship with adrenal regulation,
                insulin sensitivity, and existing variations in the
                expression levels of key enzymes across individuals.</p>
                <h3 data-number="1.1" id="why-is-it-mostly-a-myth"><span
                class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why is it
                mostly a myth</h3>
                <p>Of the many steps necessary for the conversion of
                progesterone to DHT, several of the enzymes catalyzing
                each of those steps have very low affinities and
                catalytic efficiencies for progesterone and its
                derivatives. Instead, progesterone is quickly picked up
                by enzymes with much better affinity and preferentially
                flows towards the biosynthesis of allopregnanolone,
                responsible for progesterone’s sedative effects, various
                corticosteroids like aldosterone, or is extensively
                metabolized and eliminated by the adipose, liver, and
                kidneys. For the tiny amount that avoids this fate,
                there are several additional steps to go through before
                reaching DHT. Along the way, progesterone derivatives
                encounter similar conditions, namely low enzyme
                affinities, preferred redirections away from DHT, and
                the possibility of being metabolized, conjugated, and
                eliminated by the body. See <a href="#Figure1">Figure
                1</a> for a graphical summary.</p>
                <p>In short, the transformation of progesterone into DHT
                is a lengthy and inefficient process not favored by the
                body, except under specific conditions.</p>

                <p>One situation in which progesterone supplementation
                could lead to androgenic symptoms, including those
                caused by DHT, is in the presence of congenital adrenal
                hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a group of genetic disorders
                that disrupt steroid hormone production in the adrenal
                glands. The classical form is rare, often
                life-threatening, and typically detected in newborns. In
                contrast, the nonclassical form (ncCAH) is more common
                with an incidence rate of at least 1 in 1,000 and
                potentially as high as 1 in 200 and frequently goes
                undiagnosed for years, especially in milder cases. ncCAH
                can cause symptoms like premature puberty, excessive
                hair growth, acne, or irregular periods in people with
                ovaries, often overlapping with conditions like
                polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In cis men, symptoms
                may be subtle or overlooked, as they may align with
                typical gender expectations. Trans feminine individuals
                may also face challenges, as symptoms of poor
                feminization despite hormone replacement therapy are
                often dismissed or misunderstood due to lack of
                awareness and biases in healthcare.</p>
                <p>Both forms of CAH are caused by enzyme deficiencies,
                most commonly 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). This
                impairs the usual conversion of progesterone and related
                hormones into cortisol and aldosterone, and causes an
                accumulation and spillover into pathways that produce
                androgens, often resulting in symptoms of
                hyperandrogenism. Progesterone supplementation in
                individuals with ncCAH could worsen this imbalance,
                potentially turning a mild or asymptomatic case into one
                with clinically significant androgenic symptoms.</p>
                <p>Finally, progesterone has a complex relationship with
                the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and
                insulin signaling, which regulate stress responses,
                immune function, salt and water balance, and glucose
                metabolism. It is a potent antimineralocorticoid and
                modulator of insulin and prolactin secretion, it rapidly
                accumulates in tissues, and is extensively metabolized
                into various steroid derivatives in the liver, adrenals,
                and adipose tissue—each with its own regulatory effects.
                Consequently, using progesterone non-orally (e.g.,
                rectally or via intramuscular injection) continuously
                and in large doses carries the risk of disrupting
                hormonal and metabolic balances, even in individuals
                without enzymatic deficiencies. This disruption could
                lead to symptoms that may be mistakenly interpreted as
                signs of androgenic activity, but given the role of
                insulin in modulating adrenal response, androgen
                steroidogenic pathways, and the downstream inhibition of
                aromatase, progesterone might indirectly cause symptoms
                of PCOS-like hyperandrogenicity.</p>
                <p>Emerging evidence suggests that a PCOS-like condition
                may exist in individuals without ovarian tissue,
                characterized by metabolic and hormonal abnormalities
                similar to those seen in ovarian PCOS, such as insulin
                resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and
                early-onset androgenetic alopecia (AGA). This condition
                is particularly prevalent in first-degree relatives of
                individuals with ovarian PCOS, indicating a potential
                genetic component. Early-onset AGA, defined as hair loss
                before the age of 35, has been proposed as a clinical
                marker of this condition, as it is frequently observed
                in families with a history of ovarian PCOS. Individuals
                without ovarian tissue who exhibit this condition often
                show elevated levels of LH, DHEA-S, 17OH-P, and
                prolactin, along with reduced levels of SHBG and FSH.
                Insulin resistance is a key feature, with studies
                showing that individuals with early-onset AGA and
                hormonal abnormalities similar to ovarian PCOS exhibit
                higher insulin resistance compared to those without such
                hormonal changes. While hyperandrogenism is a hallmark
                of ovarian PCOS, those without ovarian tissue and with
                this condition often have normal or even subnormal
                testosterone levels, suggesting that the clinical signs
                of hyperandrogenism, such as AGA, may result from the
                conversion of weaker androgens like DHEA-S into more
                potent forms in peripheral tissues.</p>

                <p>While the diagnosis of ncCAH caused by 21OHD used to
                be difficult, recent research found 21-deoxycortisol to
                be a biomarker offering near-perfect diagnostic accuracy
                when using the more accurate and precise LC-MS/MS assay
                instead of immunoassays. Cases of ncCAH caused by 11OHD,
                fortunately much rarer, are likely to cause additional
                difficulties and require not only steroid panels but
                in-depth genetic analysis. PCOS-like hyperandrogenicity
                may indicate the presence of hyperinsulinemia, incipient
                insulin resistance, or a non-ovarian PCOS-like
                condition, in which case a glucose resistance test and
                possibly an 11-oxygenated androgen panel could be
                recommended.</p>

                class="header-section-number">1.4</span> What can be
                done</h3>
                <p>Fortunately, interventions are available and
                relatively straightforward. In all cases, discontinuing
                progesterone supplementation is strongly recommended.
                For individuals who were previously asymptomatic, this
                step alone is often sufficient. For those who started
                progesterone to address unsatisfactory feminization
                outcomes and experienced a significant worsening of
                androgenic symptoms such as acne, increased body hair,
                and male pattern hair loss—or for those without access
                to specialized care—dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) is the
                preferred treatment. If dutasteride is unavailable,
                bicalutamide (25-50 mg/day) or finasteride (1 mg/day)
                can serve as alternative options. In the very rare case
                of 11-hydroxylase deficiency, 5α-reductase inhibitors
                should be avoided. For individuals with access to
                specialized healthcare, we recommend seeking a formal
                diagnosis for potential adrenal disorders, which may
                lead to low-dose glucocorticoid therapy under the
                supervision of a medical professional, or for a
                PCOS-like disorder in which case metformin or inositol
                supplementation may be recommended. We strongly
                discourage attempting glucocorticoid therapy without
                proper medical oversight, as improper use—including at
                low doses and especially during long-term use—can lead
                to serious side effects, including immune suppression,
                bone density loss, metabolic disturbances, and dangers
                associated with abrupt discontinuation.</p>

                Intracrinology and Modern Theory</h2>
                <p>For an excellent and in-depth review of modern
                intracrine androgen biosynthesis theory, see Schiffer
                <em>et al.</em> (2018) [<a

                <p>DHT is a more potent form of testosterone, exhibiting
                2 to 3 times the affinity and potency at the androgen
                receptor (AR). Beyond the enzymes that catalyze and
                metabolize them, DHT and T differ not only in their
                quantitative potency at the AR but also qualitatively
                due to differences in their transactivation profiles [<a
                href="#DeslypereA1992">25</a>, <a
                href="#BolducA2004">12</a>, <a href="#AskewA2007">2</a>,

                href="#WuA2011">115</a>, <a href="#HsiaoA2000">49</a>,
                <a href="#HolterhusA2002">43</a>]. Although the precise
                mechanisms remain unclear, these differences arise from
                the existence of selective androgen response elements
                (AREs) [<a href="#HsiaoA2000">49</a>] and the
                differential recruitment of cofactors between AR-bound T
                and DHT caused by slight geometric differences in the
                conformational changes they induce. As a result, DHT and
                T do not activate the same genes in the same ways, and
                they do so differently across tissues.</p>
                <p>DHT is not produced by the testes. Instead, it is
                synthesized in the liver and prostate through the
                5α-reduction of T produced and released into circulation
                by the testes, as well as intracrinally using adrenal
                DHEA-S [<a href="#Labrie1991">58</a>, <a
                href="#LabrieA2005">61</a>, <a
                href="#SchifferA2018">97</a>]. Intracrinally synthesized
                DHT is extensively metabolized into 3α-androstanediol
                (3α-diol), which is then glucuronidated into
                3α-androstanediol glucuronide (3α-ADG) and released into
                circulation for elimination by the kidneys. Only about
                10% of intracrinally produced DHT exits the cell intact
                [<a href="#HortonLobo1986">47</a>, <a
                href="#Horton1992">46</a>].</p>

                href="#Sharpe2020">99</a>], the backdoor pathway is not
                a significant contributor to DHT synthesis in humans [<a
                href="#LuuThe2013">70</a>]. This is because while
                CYP17A1 has a preference for PROG/17OH-P in rodents [<a
                href="#BrockWaterman1999">14</a>] and for
                allopregnanolone/17OH-ALLOPREG in Tammar wallaby [<a
                href="#WilsonA2003">114</a>], it has an almost exclusive
                preference for pregnenolone/17OH-PREG in human [<a

                href="#GonzalezGuengerich2017">38</a>], thus favoring
                the frontdoor and 5α-dione pathways.</p>
                <p>In people without testicular androgens, serum T
                levels correlate poorly with levels of androgen
                metabolites—the obligate elimination products of all
                androgens—making them poor biomarkers of the total
                androgen pool, including DHT [<a
                href="#LabrieA2006">59</a>]. Measurement of the sum of
                androgen metabolites such as AST-G, AST-S, and 3α-diol-G
                is the only accurate serum method for measuring total
                androgen production and activity [<a
                href="#LabrieA2006">59</a>].</p>
                <p>Intracrine synthesis from adrenal precursors may
                contribute approximately 25-50% of total DHT in tissues,
                as evidenced by intra-prostatic DHT levels following
                castration [<a href="#YoonA2008">119</a>, <a
                href="#NishiyamaA2004">85</a>, <a
                href="#MostaghelA2007">78</a>] and the observed 59%
                decrease in total androgen metabolites [<a
                href="#BelangerA1986">9</a>, <a
                href="#LabrieA2009">60</a>]. Thus, while serum levels of
                T and DHT may correlate and drop to very low levels
                following interventions such as castration,
                hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis inhibition by
                GnRH analogues, progestins, or supraphysiological
                estradiol, this drop only indicates the decreased
                production by the liver and prostate from gonadal T as a
                precursor, and do not reflect the absence of local
                intracrine DHT synthesis in peripheral DHT-sensitive
                tissues like adipose tissue, skin, the prostate, hair
                follicles, and breast tissue using the adrenal precursor
                DHEA-S.</p>
                <p>While the Δ<sup>4</sup> and Δ<sup>5</sup> frontdoor
                pathways are the primary sources of gonadal T in intact
                cis men, and by extension of circulating DHT produced in
                the liver and prostate, intracrine DHT synthesis mostly
                bypasses T and proceeds mainly via the 5α-dione pathway.
                This is supported by two key pieces of evidence [<a
                href="#LuuThe2011">69</a>]:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>5α-reductase exhibits higher affinity and efficacy
                for A4 than for T, and higher affinity for A4 than
                17α-HSD. As a result, the 5α-reduction of A4 is
                thermodynamically favored over its
                17α-dehydrogenation.</li>
                <li>The sum of all AST conjugates—the primary
                metabolites of the 5α-dione pathway starting at
                DHEA—circulates at much higher levels than 3α-ADG, the
                main metabolite of the Δ<sup>4</sup> and Δ<sup>5</sup>
                frontdoor pathways which utilize T as the precursor to
                DHT.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Finally, a fact often overlooked concerns the
                presence of a tremendous amount of interindividual
                variation in the expression levels of key enzymes (see
                <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a> and <a
                href="#Table1">Table 1</a>) involved in the the
                biosynthesis of steroids at large including
                glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens,
                11-oxygenated androgens, and of the androgen receptor
                itself [<a href="#HoppeA2006">45</a>, <a
                href="#Hoppe2006">44</a>, <a
                href="#BassettA2005">7</a>]. This variation naturally
                leads to differences in sensitivity and metabolism,
                whereby the interplay between various homeostasic
                processes and their fixed and variable set points [<a
                href="#KotasMedzhitov2015">55</a>] lead to different
                outcomes in steroid levels and androgenic effects
                between peoples despite the absence of any disorder or
                disease.</p>

                kinetics</h3>
                <p>Let’s go down the rabbit hole of enzyme kinetics.
                This is sure to get confusing, but refer to <a
                href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a> for a graphical, yet
                complete qualitative summary of all the information
                presented in the following sections, and <a
                href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> for additional quantitative
                details. The takeaway should be that during the
                biosynthesis of androgens the body conspires in various
                ways to prevent the conversion of progesterone into
                DHT.</p>
                <p>In other words the conversion of progesterone to DHT
                is highly inefficient, and understanding enzyme affinity
                is key to explaining why. Affinity is often described
                using the Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>M</sub>),
                which represents the substrate concentration at which
                the reaction rate is half of the maximum rate
                (V<sub>max</sub>). K<sub>M</sub> has two key
                interpretations: (1) it reflects binding affinity, where
                a lower K<sub>M</sub> means tighter substrate binding,
                and (2) it partially indicates catalytic efficiency
                (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>), where a low
                K<sub>M</sub> allows high reaction rates even at low
                substrate concentrations. However, affinity is not the
                same as efficacy—an enzyme may bind a substrate tightly
                (high affinity) but convert it poorly (low efficacy), or
                vice versa. Since data for k<sub>cat</sub> is less
                readily available than for K<sub>M</sub>, we will mainly
                focus on the latter, although a complete discussion
                would have to include k<sub>cat</sub> (the turnover
                number) as well.</p>

                <p>For the vast majority of us, PROG doesn’t make it to
                17OH-P, the entry point to the backdoor pathway, and one
                of the entry point to the Δ<sup>4</sup> frontdoor
                pathway to androgen biosynthesis. Those are the only two
                ways through which PROG could eventually be converted to
                DHT. Instead, it gets quickly funneled into

                towards the synthesis of allopregnanolone by
                5α-reductase [<a href="#LuuThe2013">70</a>]. Given that
                5α-reductase type 2 is strongly expressed in the liver,
                the latter scenario is especially relevant when PROG is
                taken orally and goes through first-pass metabolism. The
                strength of this redirection comes from the fact that
                the enzyme which catalyzes the reaction from PROG to
                17OH-P, 17α-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP17A1), has a very
                low affinity for PROG compared to other immediate
                catalysts—roughly 10 times less than that of
                21-hydroxylase and 30 times less than that of

                <li>continue along the Δ<sup>4</sup> frontdoor pathway
                by being converted to androstenedione (A4) by
                17,20-lyase (also encoded by CYP17A1 but requiring
                additional cofactors),</li>

                <p>The affinity of 21-hydroxylase for PROG is

                vs backdoor and glucocorticoid Pathways</h3>
                <p>Given the terrible affinity of 17α-hydroxylase for
                PROG, the main contributor to the levels of 17OH-P
                necessary for glucocorticoid biosynthesis is
                17α-hydroxypregnenolone (17OH-PREG) derived from
                pregnenolone (PREG). 17OH-PREG is incidentally the main
                precursor to all androgens through the Δ<sup>5</sup>
                frontdoor pathway. The conversion of 17OH-PREG into
                17OH-P (towards either the glucocorticoid pathways or
                the backdoor pathway) is driven by HSD3B1/HSD3B2, and
                into DHEA along the Δ<sup>5</sup> frondoor pathway by
                17,20-lyase. The affinity of 17α-hydroxylase for PREG is
                10 to 20 times greater than its affinity for PROG, and
                the affinity of 17,20-lyase for 17OH-PREG is 10 to 100
                times greater than that of HSD3B1/HSD3B2.</p>

                17OH-DHP, where it can be converted to
                17α-hydroxy-allopregnanolone (17OH-ALLOPREG) by certain
                aldo reductases and cross over through the backdoor
                pathway into androsterone (AST). The last steps are
                therefore</p>
                <ul>

                <p>The steps from AST to 5α-dione and from 3α-diol to
                DHT go ‘against the flow,’ opposite to the typical
                androgen elimination pathways. These steps depend
                strongly on the redox state of the cell and the presence
                of cofactor concentration gradients, rather than the

                <p>Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a
                rare and life-threatening disorder usually detected in
                newborns using a Gurthie test and occurs in 1 in 10,000
                to 1 in 20,000 live births. On the other hand,
                nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (ncCAH) is
                relatively common and is estimate to occur in at least 1
                in 1,000 and up to 1 in 200 persons [<a
                href="#MerkeAuchus2020">73</a>]. ncCAH can present with
                various degrees of severity. In milder cases, it often
                goes undetected and untreated for most of someone’s life
                unless it causes noticeable and distressing symptoms
                such as hyperandrogenism and hirsutism, or persistent
                acne. Establishing a differential diagnostic is
                complicated because of the overlap with PCOS symtpoms
                [<a href="#YesiladaliA2022">116</a>, <a
                href="#SuminskaA2020">102</a>, <a
                href="#Auchus2015">3</a>] and with other disorders known
                to cause various forms of androgen excess [<a
                href="#HeijboerHannema2023">40</a>]. These disorders are
                likely to be overlooked in cis men for whom
                manifestations of hyperandrogenism do not raise any
                alarm and align with gender expectation, but also in
                transfeminine people due to a lack of awareness and to
                the unfortunate amount of biases and blind spots in
                standards of care and the medical community at large.
                For transfeminine people, such symptoms may lead to poor
                feminization outcome despite the use of HRT and are
                often simply dismissed as regrettably natural and
                expected, mysterious and intractable, or imaginary and
                stemming from impatience, anxiety, and gender
                dysphoria.</p>
                <p>In CAH and ncCAH caused by 21-hyroxylase deficiency
                (21OHP), mutations in the gene CYP21A2 coding for the
                enzyme 21-hydroxylase lead to a partial reduction
                (ncCAH) or a complete reduction (CAH) of the efficiency
                with which progesterone (PROG) is metabolized into
                aldosterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OH-P) into
                cortisol. Impaired aldosterone and cortisol synthesis
                lead to the loss of negative feedback on the
                hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and therefore to the
                stimulation of ACTH secretion and eventually to adrenal
                overactivity and hyperplasia. The resulting increase in
                the synthesis of corticosteroid precursors by overactive
                adrenals in the absence of efficient catalysis by
                21-hydroxylase causes accumulation of high levels of
                PROG and 17OH-P and to the deflection of catalysis
                towards pathways that are usually less favored, all of
                which increase the total pool of androgens in one way or
                another and can lead to symptoms of
                hyperandrogenism.</p>

                supplementation and 21OHD</h4>
                <p>In the context of 21OHD, progesterone supplementation
                can cause progesterone pooling, as it cannot enter the
                mineralocorticoid pathways as readily—or at all in the
                classical case. This pooling can divert progesterone
                into several metabolic pathways, each with significant
                consequences:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>Δ<sup>5</sup> pathway spillover: Progesterone may
                accumulate distally as pregnenolone, leading to
                spillover into the Δ<sup>5</sup> frontdoor pathway. This
                can generate large amounts of DHEA-S released in
                systemic circulation, potentially enhancing the
                intracrine synthesis of strong androgens in peripheral
                tissues as modulated by individual enzymatic expression
                levels. Incidentally, the obligate generation of the
                intermediate 17OH-PREG may exacerbate the next two
                points since it is a precursor of 17OH-P.</li>
                <li>Δ<sup>4</sup> and backdoor pathways spillover:
                Despite 17α-hydroxylase’s relatively low affinity for
                progesterone, spillover into the Δ<sup>4</sup> frontdoor
                and backdoor pathways remains possible. In fact,
                17α-hydroxylase’s catalytic efficiency
                (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) for progesterone is of a
                similar order of magnitude as for pregnenolone [<a
                href="#GonzalezGuengerich2017">38</a>]. The conversion
                of progesterone into 17OH-P could exacerbate
                hyperandrogenic symptoms typical of 21OHD. Additionally,
                progesterone’s high affinity for 5α-reductase may lead
                to its conversion into allopregnanolone, potentially
                causing benzodiazepine-like sedative effects.</li>
                <li>11-oxygenated androgen pathway: A less well-known
                pathway involves the initial 11-hydroxylation of
                progesterone by CYP11B1/2 (though affinity and efficacy
                data for CYP11B and progesterone are lacking). This
                could transform progesterone into
                11β-hydroxyprogesterone (11OH-P), which may then be
                17α-hydroxylated into 21DF. From there, it could enter
                the 11-oxygenated androgen pathways [<a
                href="#vanRooyenA2018">109</a>, <a
                href="#GentA2024">36</a>]. Since 11-oxygenated androgens
                are major contributors to androgen excess in CAH [<a
                href="#Turcu2016">107</a>, <a
                href="#KamrathA2018">52</a>], progesterone
                supplementation could trigger hyperandrogenic symptoms
                even in mild or asymptomatic cases.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Fortunately, interventions are available and
                relatively straightforward. Discontinuing progesterone
                supplementation is strongly recommended. For individuals
                who were previously asymptomatic, this step alone is
                often sufficient. For those who started progesterone to
                address unsatisfactory feminization outcomes and
                subsequently experienced worsening androgenic symptoms
                (e.g., acne, increased body hair, or male pattern hair
                loss)—or for those without access to specialized
                care—dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) is the preferred
                treatment. If dutasteride is unavailable, bicalutamide
                (25-50 mg/day) or finasteride (1 mg/day) can serve as
                alternatives. For individuals with access to specialized
                healthcare, we recommend seeking a formal diagnosis for
                potential adrenal disorders, which may lead to low-dose
                glucocorticoid therapy under medical supervision [<a

                href="#CarminaA2017">18</a>]. Self-administered
                glucocorticoid therapy is strongly discouraged, as
                improper use—even at low doses or over the long term—can
                lead to serious side effects, including immune
                suppression, bone density loss, metabolic disturbances,
                and risks associated with abrupt discontinuation [<a

                deficiency</h3>
                <p>11β-Hydroxylase deficiency (11OHD) is the second most
                common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),
                accounting for approximately 5-8% of all CAH cases, with
                an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 200,000
                live births in non-consanguineous populations [<a
                href="#New2003">83</a>, <a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>].
                11OHD is caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene, which
                encodes the enzyme mainly responsible for converting
                11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone
                (DOC) to corticosterone, P4 to 11β-hydroxyprogesterone,
                17OH-P to 21-deoxycortisol, and also A4 and T into their
                11-oxygenated androgen counterparts 11OH-A4 and 11OH-T.
                The deficiency leads to a buildup of precursor steroids,
                including DOC, which has mineralocorticoid activity, and
                adrenal androgens. The severity with which mutations in
                CYP11B1 impair the efficacy of its 11β-hydroxylase
                action gives rise to a spectrum of clinical
                manifestations ranging from the more severe classic form
                (c11OHD) to milder nonclassical form (nc11OHD) [<a
                href="#New2003">83</a>, <a href="#MenaboA2014">72</a>,
                <a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>].</p>
                <p>Classic 11OHD is characterized by hypertension,
                ambiguous genitalia in females, and hyperandrogenism in
                both sexes. Hypertension, a hallmark of c11OHD, results
                from the accumulation of DOC, which activates the
                mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to sodium retention
                and volume expansion. This is a key feature that
                distinguishes 11OHD from 21OHD, which typically presents
                with salt-wasting due to aldosterone deficiency [<a
                href="#New2003">83</a>, <a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>].
                Females with c11OHD are often diagnosed at birth due to
                ambiguous genitalia, while males may present later in
                childhood with signs of precocious pseudopuberty,
                accelerated growth, and advanced bone age. Untreated
                c11OHD can lead to short adult height often falling 2-3
                standard deviations or more below the population mean
                [<a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>].</p>
                <p>Non-classical 11OHD is a milder form of the disorder,
                with symptoms typically appearing later in childhood or
                adolescence. Unlike c11OHD, nc11OHD does not present
                with ambiguous genitalia or hypertension, making it
                harder to diagnose. Patients may exhibit premature
                pubarche, hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities, and
                infertility, all symptoms that overlap with ncCAH due to
                21OHD [<a href="#MenaboA2014">72</a>, <a
                href="#YildizA2021">117</a>]. The incidence of nc11OHD
                is less well-defined, but it is thought to be rarer than
                the classic form. Some cases may be asymptomatic or
                present with very mild symptoms, escaping clinical
                attention unless steroid profiling or genetic testing is
                performed [<a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>]. The milder
                phenotype in nc11OHD is attributed to residual enzyme
                activity, with some mutations retaining 5-10% of normal
                function and thus partial cortisol synthesis and less
                severe androgen excess [<a
                href="#MenaboA2014">72</a>].</p>

                class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Diagnosis of
                ncCAH with 11OHD</h4>
                <p>Diagnosis of 11OHD relies on steroid profiling,
                particularly the measurement of 11-deoxycortisol, DOC,
                and A4, which are elevated in both classic and
                nonclassic forms, and 11-oxygenated androgens may be
                significantly lower [<a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>]. As
                discussed earlier, 21OHD is characterized by elevated
                levels of 17OH-P, 21DF, and 11-oxygenated androgens,
                which are not typically observed in 11OHD [<a
                href="#New2003">83</a>, <a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>,
                <a href="#TurcuA2020">105</a>]. However, it remains
                unclear whether hyperandrogenism in this condition could
                partially arise from backdoor androgen conversion. On
                one hand, the absence of elevated 17OH-P might suggest
                that such conversion is not occurring. On the other
                hand, the presence of elevated A4 points to a spillover
                effect into the Δ<sup>4</sup> pathway. Given that 17OH-P
                serves as an entry point for both pathways, it is
                plausible that this spillover could extend to the
                backdoor pathway as well. The 11-deoxycortisol/cortisol
                ratio is a key diagnostic marker, with values &gt;2.2
                indicating n11OHD, values &lt;1.5 suggesting nc11OHD,
                and values &lt;0.1 indicating absence of 11OHD, reaching
                100% specificity [<a href="#YildizA2021">117</a>]. ACTH
                stimulation tests and genetic testing for CYP11B1
                mutations are essential for confirming the diagnosis and
                differentiating 11OHD from other forms of CAH. Like
                21OHD, treatment for both c- and nc11OHD involves
                glucocorticoid replacement to suppress ACTH-driven
                androgen production and monitoring to avoid
                over-replacement, which can exacerbate growth impairment
                and metabolic complications [<a href="#New2003">83</a>,

                supplementation and 11OHD</h3>
                <p>In cases of 11OHD, progesterone supplementation may
                lead to significant accumulation and pooling of DOC and
                progesterone, with spillover into 17OH-P, subsequently
                increasing 11-deoxycortisol levels. To counteract this,
                the body may upregulate 5α-reductase, a key clearance
                pathway for 4-ene-3-one corticosteroids [<a
                href="#NasiriA2015">81</a>, <a

                href="#KanehisaGotto2002">53</a>]. While speculative,
                this upregulation could enhance activity through the
                5α-dione pathway and increase the direct conversion of
                adrenal precursors into DHT, potentially exacerbating
                androgenic symptoms.</p>
                <p>Out of caution, dutasteride and finasteride might be
                contraindicated in these cases, as blocking 5α-reductase
                could further exacerbate DOC and 11-deoxycortisol
                accumulation, potentially leading to metabolic
                complications such as hypertension or electrolyte
                imbalances. In such scenarios, bicalutamide may be a
                preferable alternative if residual androgenic symptoms

                polycystic ovarian morphology [<a

                phenotype (80% of cases) and the lean phenotype, which
                is often underdiagnosed due to milder symptoms.
                Symptoms, including menstrual irregularities, hirsutism,
                acne, and alopecia, typically emerge during adolescence
                and are driven by hyperandrogenism and exacerbated by
                insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinemia, which also

                hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction but often
                overlook metabolic abnormalities, leading to
                underdiagnosis, particularly in lean people [<a
                href="#AversaA2020">4</a>]. In recent years, and
                parallel to these clinical approaches, biochemical,
                genetic, and genomic evidences have started to shed
                additional insights on PCOS subtyping [<a
                href="#DapasA2020">24</a>, <a
                href="#DapasA2022">23</a>].</p>
                <p>At the core of PCOS pathophysiology are two
                interconnected factors which reinforce each others:
                hyperandrogenism and IR-induced hyperinsulinaemia. This
                link exists due to the fact that adrenal cells, ovarian
                theca cells, and ovarian granulosa cells—the principal
                contributors to steroid biosynthesis in people with
                ovaries—retain sensitivity to insulin signalling while
                the rest of the body grows increasingly
                insulin-resistant, further exacerbating compensatory
                hyperinsulinaemia.</p>
                <p>In the following sections we will spend a significant
                amount of time reviewing this relationship as it will
                prove to be the key to understanding a potentially
                important link between progesterone and androgenic
                symptoms.</p>

                Hyperinsulinaemia as the central driver of steroidogenic
                dysregulation</h3>
                <p>The interplay between hyperinsulinemia and
                hyperandrogenism in PCOS is rooted in insulin’s ability
                to directly amplify adrenal and ovarian steroidogenesis.
                Early studies demonstrated that hyperinsulinemia
                potentiates ACTH-stimulated adrenal androgen production,
                with hyperandrogenic people with PCOS showing elevated
                17OH-PREG, 17OH-P, and DHEA during hyperinsulinemic
                clamps [<a href="#MoghettiA1996">76</a>]. This effect is
                mechanistically mirrored in adrenal cells, where insulin
                and IGF-I upregulate CYP17A1 and HSD3B2 mRNA—key enzymes
                for androgen synthesis—independently of ACTH or cAMP [<a
                href="#KristiansenA1997">56</a>]. IGF-1 and IGF-2
                further enhance ACTH responsiveness in fetal adrenal
                cells, increasing cortisol and DHEA-S via upregulated
                CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 [<a href="#MesianoA1997">74</a>].
                Moreover, people with PCOS and elevated DHEA-S exhibit
                greater net maximal and overall responses of DHEA and A4
                to ACTH stimulation compared to controls, but no
                alteration in pituitary responsiveness to CRH [<a
                href="#AzzizA1998">5</a>]. In line with these results,
                hyperinsulinemia in hyperandrogenic people with PCOS
                amplifies ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroidogenesis,
                increasing 17OH-PREG and 17OH-P levels and urinary C19
                and C21 steroid metabolites, without altering cortisol
                or androgen responses [<a href="#TosiA2011">103</a>].
                Insulin also appears to stimulate 5α-reductase activity,
                enhancing both glucocorticoid and androgen pathways [<a
                href="#TosiA2011">103</a>]. Note that variants in
                CYP17A1 and HSD11B1 show no significant association with
                PCOS or with quantitative traits of PCOS [<a
                href="#ChuaA2012">19</a>], indicating that some of those
                steroidogenesis alterations are likely the result of
                distal genetic and metabolic factors rather than
                mutations in these two genes.</p>
                <p>One of the clearest indicators of the adrenal glands’
                contribution to hyperandrogenism in PCOS is the finding
                of markedly elevated levels of 11-oxygenated adrenal
                androgens [<a href="#TurcuA2018">106</a>] in affected
                individuals. In fact, they are the main androgens in
                both obese and non-obese people with PCOS, contributing
                to 53% of total circulating androgens vs 44% in controls
                [<a href="#OReillyA2016">87</a>]. These include 11OH-A4
                (2x increase), 11K-A4 (4x increase), 11OH-T (2x
                increase), and 11K-T (1.6x increase). Furthermore, serum
                11OH-A4 and 11K-A4 correlate significantly with markers
                of insulin resistance [<a href="#OReillyA2016">87</a>],
                and urinary AST and etiocholanolone were found to be
                roughly twice as high in addition to their
                AST:etiocholanolone ratio being elevated (1.17 vs 0.88
                in controls) [<a href="#OReillyA2016">87</a>],
                suggesting increased activation of the backdoor pathway
                [<a href="#KamrathA2012">51</a>]. In a model of PCOS
                adipocytes, insulin induces AKR1C3 (HSD17B5) catalyzing
                the conversion of 11-oxo,17-keto androgens into
                11-oxo,17-hydroxy (e.g. 11K-A4 into 11K-T) [<a
                href="#PaulukinasA2022">90</a>] and the protective role
                of HSD11B1 in transforming 11K-T, a strong androgen,
                back into the much weaker 11OH-T [<a
                href="#PaulukinasA2022">90</a>]. People with severe IR
                but without PCOS show a similar pattern of elevated
                11-oxygenated androgens (2.9x higher 11OH-A4, 2.4x
                higher 11K-A4, 3.6x higher 11K-T) mediated by adrenal
                insulin signalling which is supported by its absence in
                those for whom an intrinsic dysfunction of the insulin
                receptor is the cause of IR [<a
                href="#WalzerA2022">111</a>]. Analysis of urinary
                metabolites in people with PCOS reveals the upregulation
                of CYP21A2, CYP11B1, HSD11B2, and the downregulation of
                HSD11B1 and aromatase [<a href="#DhayatA2018">26</a>].
                This aligns with the previous results showing elevated
                11-oxygenated androgens. Indeed, upregulation of CYP11B1
                enhanced the conversion of androgens into their
                11-hydroxy derivatives, and enhancement of HSD11B2 and
                downregulation of HSD11B1 implies that the
                transformation of 11-hydroxy androgens into 11-keto is
                subsequently enhanced. Further exacerbation of the
                synthesis of the two most potent 11-oxygenated
                androgens—11K-T and 11K-DHT—follows from the
                upregulation of SRD5A1 and AKR1C3 as previously
                described. This is significant given that 11K-T and
                11K-DHT possess equivalent induction at 1 nM [<a
                href="#StorbeckA2013">101</a>], efficacy (maximum
                effect) [<a href="#PretoriusA2016">92</a>], and potency
                (concentration at 50% maximum effect) [<a
                href="#PretoriusA2016">92</a>] (but see [<a
                href="#RegeA2013">93</a>]) at the AR than their
                non-oxygenated counterparts.</p>
                <p>The liver, remaining insulin-resistant, contributes
                to impaired synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin
                (SHBG), resulting in elevated systemic levels of free
                testosterone beyond the localized effects in ovarian and
                adrenal tissues [<a href="#WallaceA2013">110</a>]. This
                phenomenon is further supported by the effects of
                metformin in people with PCOS: treatment reduces
                hyperinsulinemia, lowers plasma free testosterone, and
                decreases ovarian CYP17A1 activity, as demonstrated by a
                diminished 17OH-P response to hCG stimulation, and these
                changes are accompanied by increased SHBG levels and
                improved insulin sensitivity [<a
                href="#laMarcaA2000">57</a>].</p>
                <p>In the ovary, insulin’s role is equally significant.
                Insulin stimulates testosterone biosynthesis in PCOS
                thecal cells via its own receptor, as shown by blockade
                with insulin receptor antibodies [<a
                href="#NestlerA1998">82</a>]. This insulin-specific
                effect is mediated by chiro-inositol-derived signaling
                molecules (e.g., INS-2), which amplify androgen
                production while leaving LH/hCG pathways intact [<a
                href="#NestlerA1998">82</a>]. CYP17A1—the rate-limiting
                enzyme for androgen synthesis—exhibits 4-fold higher
                promoter activity in PCOS theca cells under both basal
                and cAMP-stimulated conditions [<a
                href="#WickenheisserA2000">113</a>], a phenomenon
                exacerbated by insulin’s activation of the PI3-kinase
                pathway, which enhances 17α-hydroxylase activity [<a
                href="#MunirA2004">79</a>]. Insulin further amplifies
                androgenicity by upregulating 5α-reductase (SRD5A1) in
                granulosa cells via Akt signaling, increasing 5α-reduced
                androgens that impair follicular development [<a

                Hyperinsulanaemia, aromatase, and the inositol feedback
                loop</h3>
                <p>While insulin directly stimulates steroidogenic
                enzymes, it concurrently disrupts inositol metabolism,
                creating a self-reinforcing cycle of hyperandrogenism.
                Seminal studies by Heimark <em>et al.</em> and Unfer
                <em>et al.</em> revealed that hyperinsulinemia drives
                excessive epimerization of myo-inositol (MYO) to
                D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in ovarian tissues, collapsing
                the MYO:DCI ratio from 100:1 in healthy follicles to
                0.2:1 in PCOS [<a href="#HeimarkA2014">41</a>, <a
                href="#UnferA2014">108</a>]. This “DCI
                paradox”—conjectured by Carlomagno <em>et al.</em> a few
                years prior [<a href="#CarlomagnoA2011">17</a>]—reflects
                insulin’s dual role: while inducing peripheral insulin
                resistance, it paradoxically enhances ovarian insulin
                sensitivity, upregulating epimerase activity and
                depleting MYO—a critical mediator of FSH signaling and
                follicular maturation [<a href="#HeimarkA2014">41</a>,
                <a href="#UnferA2014">108</a>].</p>
                <p>DCI’s downstream effects compound insulin’s
                pro-androgenic actions. Although DCI improves insulin
                sensitivity, it suppresses CYP19A1 (aromatase) and
                CYP11A1 expression, reducing estrogen synthesis while
                leaving androgen production unchecked [<a
                href="#SacchiA2016">95</a>]. Insulin, acting as a
                co-gonadotropin, further amplifies steroidogenic gene
                expression (e.g., CYP11A1, IGF-1R) in the presence of
                FSH/LH, but this is counterbalanced by DCI’s inhibitory
                effects [<a href="#SacchiA2016">95</a>]. The net result
                is a milieu favoring androgen accumulation, as seen in
                clinical studies where DCI supplementation elevates
                testosterone and DHEA while lowering estrogens [<a
                href="#NordioA2021">86</a>, <a
                href="#MonastraA2021">77</a>], and conversely the
                success of MYO supplementation as an safe and effective
                treatment capable of restauring menstrual cyclicity,
                response to gonadotropins, and reduce hyperandrogenic

                <p>There is growing evidence to suggest that a
                “male”/non-ovarian equivalent of PCOS may exist,
                characterized by metabolic, and hormonal abnormalities
                similar to those seen in typical PCOS such as insulin
                resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, as well as a
                high prevalence of early-onset androgenetic alopecia
                (AGA) [<a href="#AversaA2020">4</a>, <a
                href="#CannarellaA2018">15</a>, <a
                href="#DiGuardoA2020">27</a>]. This is especially
                prevalent in first degree male relatives, particularly
                brothers, and suggests that PCOS may have a genetic
                component that affects both sexes [<a
                href="#LundeA1989">68</a>, <a href="#LafciA2024">62</a>,
                <a href="#YilmazA2018">118</a>]. Early-onset AGA,
                defined as hair loss before the age of 35, has been
                proposed as a clinical marker of the non-ovarian PCOS
                equivalent, as it is frequently observed in families
                with a history of PCOS in addition a hormonal profile
                typically associated with ovarian PCOS [<a
                href="#DuskovaA2004">31</a>].</p>
                <p>This profile includes elevated levels of LH, DHEA-S,
                17OH-P, and prolactin, alongside decreased levels of
                SBHG and FSH [<a href="#DuskovaA2004">31</a>, <a
                href="#DiGuardoA2020">27</a>, <a

                href="#SankeA2016">96</a>]. Insulin resistance is a key
                feature, with studies showing that people with
                early-onset AGA and hormonal abnormalities similar to
                PCOS exhibit higher insulin resistance compared to those
                without such hormonal changes. Lower SHBG levels have
                been associated with impaired glucose metabolism and may
                serve as a marker for insulin resistance and
                hyperglycemia in these people. While hyperandrogenism is
                a hallmark of ovarian PCOS, non-ovarian PCOS often
                co-occurs with normal or even subnormal testosterone
                levels [<a href="#DuskovaA2004">31</a>, <a
                href="#SankeA2016">96</a>, <a
                href="#LenarcikA2011">66</a>] (although free levels of
                the hormones may be elevated [<a
                href="#DuskovaA2004">31</a>]), suggesting that the
                clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, such as AGA, may
                result from conversion of weaker androgens like DHEA-S
                into more potent forms in peripheral tissues.
                Unfortunately, as of March 2025, to my knowledge no
                study has been published yet looking at 11-oxygenated
                androgens in people with suspected non-ovarian PCOS
                and/or early onset AGA.</p>
                <p>Diagnosing non-ovarian PCOS equivalent remains
                challenging due to the lack of standardized criteria.
                However, the presence of early-onset AGA, combined with
                a family history of PCOS, hormonal imbalances, and
                metabolic abnormalities, may suggest the condition [<a

                resistance, SHBG levels, and cardiovascular risk factors
                in people with early-onset AGA could help identify those
                at risk for long-term complications such as type 2

                persistent but unsubstantiated belief within the trans
                community that progesterone can convert to DHT. While we
                explored rare scenarios where this might occur—such as
                progesterone use potentially exacerbating and revealing
                an underlying, undiagnosed, or asymptomatic enzymatic
                deficiency—it’s important to note that anecdotal reports
                of androgenic symptoms following progesterone use remain
                relatively common and these experiences are frequently
                shared in online trans spaces. However, there is no
                evidence to suggest that all such cases are invariably
                caused by those less common situations, or by nothing
                more than coincidental factors and misattributions by
                those experiencing them. In this final section we will
                discuss somewhat speculatively a potential indirect
                effect which could link progesterone and androgenic
                symptoms.</p>

                <p>We spent a sizeable and perhaps unexpected amount of
                time in the previous section exploring various metabolic
                consequences of IR-induced hyperinsulinemia in PCOS and
                how they lead directly to hyperandrogenism. This was
                intentional as several studies in the 70s and 80s have
                demonstrated that progestone has significant modulatory
                effects on insulin response and levels.</p>
                <p>Daily progesterone treatment of Rhesus monkeys for
                three weeks (subcutaneous 20 mg/day in olive oil, human
                equivalent dose (HED) of 130 mg/day [<a
                href="#NairJacob2016">80</a>]) significantly enhanced
                plasma insulin responses to intravenous glucose (3x vs
                control) without altering glucose tolerance, while
                inducing mild peripheral resistance to exogenous
                insulin. Progesterone also reversed the glucose
                intolerance caused by hydrocortisone, suggesting it
                enhances compensatory insulin secretion [<a
                href="#Beck1969">8</a>]. Unfortunately, a potential
                mix-up between variance and standard deviation in the
                statistical analysis may have led to false-negatives,
                undermining further results. In a related study,
                pregnant and steroid-treated female rats received daily
                progesterone (1.25 mg/day, 2.5 mg/day, and 5 mg/day
                subcutaneously in sesame oil, HED of 80 mg/day, 160
                mg/day, 320 mg/day) and estradiol in a 1:1000 ratio with
                the progesterone dose, either alone or in combination,
                for 21 days. Plasma insulin responses during glucose
                tolerance tests were elevated in both pregnant and
                steroid-treated rats, with estradiol lowering
                post-challenge glucose levels. Progesterone increased
                insulin secretion without significantly affecting
                glucose levels, indicating that chronic exposure to
                estradiol and progesterone enhances insulin secretion
                and islet hypertrophy [<a
                href="#CostriniKalkhoff1971">22</a>]. In fact, female
                rats injected daily for 15 days with 5 mg progesterone
                (HED of 320 mg/day) and 5 µg estradiol exhibited islets
                with enhanced insulin response of around 60% at 20
                mmol/L of glucose or at 6 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L glucose
                and theophylline (a cAMP enhancer), without changes in
                adenylate cyclase activity. In vitro, islets cultured
                with 10 µg/ml progesterone and 1 µg/ml estradiol for 20
                hours also showed increased insulin secretion,
                particularly with glucose and theophylline. These
                findings suggest that progesterone and estradiol enhance
                insulin secretion directly, independent of adenylate
                cyclase activation, likely through long-term effects on
                islet function [<a href="#HowellA1977">48</a>].</p>
                <p>Further investigations into the combined effects of
                progesterone and estradiol revealed that female rats
                receiving daily subcutaneous injections of progesterone
                (2.5 mg/day for 14 days, then 5 mg/day for 7 days, HED
                of 160 mg/day then 320 mg/day) and estradiol in a 1:1000
                ratio exhibited suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis and
                increased liver glycogen deposition. Plasma insulin
                levels were significantly elevated in all groups (~50%
                in progesterone or estradiol groups, and ~100% in
                progesterone + estradiol group), suggesting that
                estradiol and progesterone, particularly in combination,
                promote insulin-like effects on liver carbohydrate
                metabolism, enhancing glycogen storage and reducing
                glucose production, without inducing insulin resistance
                [<a href="#MatuteKalkhoff1973">71</a>].</p>
                <p>In human studies, daily intramuscular progesterone
                administration (4 subjects received 300 mg/day, 3
                subjects received 400 mg/day) over six days was used to
                reach urinary pregnanediol levels comparable to late
                pregnancy. Progesterone significantly increased fasting
                plasma insulin levels and enhanced insulin responses
                during oral glucose and intravenous tolbutamide (an
                insulin secretion stimulator) tolerance tests, without
                altering fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids,
                cortisol, or growth hormone (GH) levels. These changes
                mirrored the hyperinsulinemia observed in late
                pregnancy, suggesting that progesterone contributes to
                the augmented plasma insulin response seen during
                gestation, likely as a compensatory mechanism to
                peripheral insulin resistance [<a
                href="#KalkhoffA1970">50</a>]. Similarly, fifteen normal
                non-diabetic adults receiving daily intramuscular
                progesterone (300–400 mg) for 3–5 days showed
                significantly increased plasma insulin responses during
                oral glucose and intravenous arginine (a GH secretion
                stimulator) tests, while plasma glucose increments
                during arginine infusion were reduced. Progesterone also
                blunted peak GH responses to glucose, insulin-induced
                hypoglycemia, and arginine in most subjects, though two
                female subjects showed paradoxical increases in GH.
                These findings suggest that progesterone contributes to
                the suppression of pituitary GH release and
                hyperinsulinemia observed in late pregnancy, likely
                through central mechanisms rather than direct pituitary
                effects [<a href="#BhatiaA1972">10</a>].</p>
                <p>The time-dependent modulation of insulin sensitivity
                by progesterone was further explored using a
                euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in ovariectomized
                rats. Subcutaneous administration of progesterone and
                estradiol every 12 hours for 20 days to mimic pregnancy
                hormone levels indicated that progesterone increased
                insulin sensitivity at high concentrations, while
                estradiol enhanced sensitivity at low levels but reduced
                it at high concentrations. These results suggest that
                estradiol improves insulin sensitivity early in
                pregnancy, whereas progesterone counteracts this effect
                later, contributing to the insulin resistance observed
                in late pregnancy, possibly as a way to maintain glucose
                homeostasis during gestation [<a
                href="#GonzalezA2000">37</a>].</p>
                <p>At the cellular level, a novel mechanism involving
                the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1)
                was identified. In Hep3B cells, PGRMC1 activation
                increased cAMP levels, leading to the induction of
                phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression and
                enhanced gluconeogenesis. Progesterone similarly
                upregulated PGRMC1, cAMP, and PEPCK, increasing glucose
                production in hepatocytes. In vivo, progesterone
                suppressed gluconeogenesis under normal conditions by
                promoting insulin secretion but increased blood glucose
                via gluconeogenesis in insulin-deficient and
                insulin-resistant states. These findings suggest that
                PGRMC1-mediated gluconeogenesis exacerbates
                hyperglycemia in diabetes [<a href="#LeeA2020">64</a>].
                Furthermore, it was found that progesterone receptor
                knockout (PR−/−) mice exhibit improved glucose
                homeostasis due to enhanced β-cell proliferation and
                insulin secretion. Female PR−/− mice showed lower
                fasting glycemia and higher insulin levels during
                glucose tolerance tests compared to wild-type (PR+/+)
                mice. Pancreatic islets from PR−/− mice were larger and
                secreted more insulin, attributed to an increase in
                β-cell mass driven by elevated β-cell proliferation,
                rather than reduced apoptosis. In contrast, progesterone
                treatment in diabetic db/db mice accelerated diabetes
                progression, while the progesterone receptor antagonist
                RU486 reduced blood glucose levels [<a

                <p>In summary, progesterone exerts complex,
                time-dependent effects on insulin secretion,
                sensitivity, and glucose metabolism. It enhances
                compensatory insulin responses and β-cell function,
                which may contribute to hyperinsulinemia and, over time,
                the development or exacerbation of insulin resistance
                and metabolic dysregulation in susceptible
                individuals—such as those with insulin deficiency,
                asymptomatic/incipient insulin resistance, prediabetes,
                people with T2DM, and first degree relatives of people
                with PCOS.</p>
                <p>Integrating previous findings on progesterone and
                PCOS, chronic progesterone supplementation may carry
                risks and further complications possibly impacting
                transition outcomes which, as far as I know, have be
                overlooked:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>High doses of non-oral PROG/E2 could accelerate the
                progression of IR and hyperinsulinemia in asymptomatic
                or prediabetic transgender individuals undergoing GAHT.
                This could lead to the development or exacerbation of
                androgenic symptoms by enhancing steroid biosynthetic
                pathways in the adrenals with a focus on 11-oxygenated
                androgens, and thus despite suppression of the HPG axis
                and gonadal T production.</li>
                <li>PROG/E2-induced hyperinsulinemia in non-diabetic,
                non-insulin-resistant transgender individuals may
                amplify steroid biosynthetic pathways in hormonally
                active organs but extending beyond the ovaries and
                adrenals due to the absence of IR. This effect could
                occur through mechanisms ressembling those observed in
                PCOS in tissues with overlapping expression of key
                enzymes. For example, in tissues like the skin,
                follicles, and adipose, this process might upregulate
                5α-reductase and AKR1C3 both implicated in the synthesis
                of all strong androgens, and alter the MYO:DCI ratio,
                thus upregulating epimerase activity and ultimately
                resulting in some degree of aromatase inhibition.</li>
                <li>Hyperinsulinemia-induced suppression of SHBG
                production in the liver may act as a double-edged sword,
                potentially increasing free estradiol, but also free
                testosterone levels.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These inferences, however, are likely premature for
                several reasons. First, PCOS is a highly complex
                syndrome, and the link between IR and hyperandrogenism
                may depend on additional factors, such as distal genetic
                and metabolic components. Second, the role of
                progesterone in the development of insulin resistance
                and gestational diabetes remains poorly understood [<a
                href="#BranisteanuMathieu2003">13</a>]. Third, it is
                possible that positive aspects of progesterone such as
                its anti-inflammatory effects [<a
                href="#FedotchevaA2022">32</a>] and its action as a
                competitive inhibitor of 5α-reductase in vitro [<a
                href="#RiznerA2011">94</a>, <a href="#LevyA1995">67</a>,
                <a href="#SchomburgA2002">98</a>] could offset some of
                its risks. Finally, many of the findings discussed here
                are derived from animal and/or in vitro studies, and
                their extrapolation to humans and in vivo settings comes
                with significant caveats. Nonetheless, the in vivo
                induction of hyperinsulinemia in both male and female
                human subjects [<a href="#KalkhoffA1970">50</a>, <a
                href="#BhatiaA1972">10</a>] and Rhesus monkeys [<a
                href="#Beck1969">8</a>] alone should be cause for pause
                before deciding to begin non-oral progesterone
                supplementation within the context of GAHT.</p>
                <h2 data-number="7" id="conclusion"><span
                class="header-section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The relationship between progesterone, DHT, and the
                backdoor pathway is complex and context-dependent. The
                myth of progesterone’s direct androgenic effects is
                largely unfounded because its conversion into DHT is
                negligeable in healthy individuals. On the other hand,
                specific conditions such as ncCAH and PCOS can disrupt
                normal steroidogenesis, leading to metabolic and
                hormonal dysregulation and to hyperandrogenism and can
                occur in the transgender population as much as in any
                other. Progesterone supplementation may exacerbate these
                conditions by causing elevation and accumulation of
                steroid precursors, or by its induction of
                hyperinsulinemia. While progesterone’s role in androgen
                synthesis is complicated by its interactions with the
                HPA axis and insulin sensitivity, its potential to exert
                an indirect influence on androgenic symptoms, especially
                in individuals with underlying metabolic or endocrine
                vulnerabilities, cannot be readily dismissed. Future
                research should focus on clarifying these mechanisms to
                optimize therapeutic strategies and improve transition
                outcomes in clinical and GAHT settings.</p>
