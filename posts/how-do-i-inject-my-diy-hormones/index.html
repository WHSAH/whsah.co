                        do I draw from the vial? What with?</h2>
                        <p>Getting needles from a trustworthy source is
                        a good idea;
                        <a href="https://www.exchangesupplies.org" target="_blank">exchangesupplies.org</a>
                        and in-person needle exchanges are good. Other
                        sites exist too.</p>
                        <p>To draw from your vial, you will need to use
                        a needle that is 23G or smaller (bigger number =
                        smaller gauge, 18G will wreck it). This avoids
                        damaging the stopper, which if broken will allow
                        bacteria to get inside of the vial! Before
                        drawing, wipe the top of the vial with a 70%
                        isopropyl alcohol wipe. Never use anything else:
                        not sanitiser, no other alcohol percentage. It
                        is better to use nothing than an alternative.
                        You do not need to use a wipe on your skin; this
                        can cause irritation. If your skin is free of
                        dirt you will be okay.</p>
                        <p>If your vial has a circle on the top of the
                        stopper, poke it in the circle; if not then
                        anywhere near the centre is ok. Do your best to
                        use different places on the stopper each time,
                        and poke it at a 90 degree angle (right
                        angle).</p>
                        <p>Dispose of the needle in a sharps bin.
                        Sometimes councils will pick them up when they
                        are full, or you will need to find a place
                        nearby to dispose them (such as a needle
                        exchange).</p>
                        <p>Before drawing from your vial, draw air into
                        your syringe that is equal to your dose; if
                        you’re injecting 0.1 mL, then draw 0.1 mL of air
                        into your syringe, put the needle into the vial,
                        push in the air and then draw your dose. This
                        means you don’t create a vacuum inside the vial,
                        which makes it easier to draw.</p>

                        id="never-share-needles-or-syringes">NEVER SHARE
                        NEEDLES OR SYRINGES!</h2>
                        <p>Never reuse a needle/syringe you or someone
                        else has used and never try to wash out one to
                        reuse it. Do not keep medication inside of a
                        syringe for longer than an hour; they are not
                        sterile beyond that timeframe, and they are not
                        made for storing medication. <strong>A needle
                        should only touch the vial stopper and your
                        skin.</strong></p>
                        <p>If you have been pricked by somebody else’s
                        needle, encourage bleeding from the site by
                        squeezing it and get to A&amp;E or dial 111.
                        Needle sticking is an extremely easy way to
                        spread blood borne diseases (such as HIV).</p>

                        id="what-needles-do-i-use-to-inject">What
                        needles do I use to inject?</h2>
                        <p>This depends on whether you are doing IM or
                        subq. For both you will need a syringe with the
                        capacity of 1 mL at maximum. (If you inject less
                        than 0.1 mL it is ideal to use smaller syringes
                        such as 0.5 mL or 0.3 mL.)</p>
                        <p>For subq it is easiest to use a low deadspace
                        fixed needle syringe, (i.e. needle and syringe
                        are 1 combined object). Unisharp fixed needles
                        are ideal; 27G and 29G are easy to find.</p>
                        <p>For IM currently the only seller of
                        appropriate fixed needle syringes is
                        exchangesupplies. If you do not buy from them
                        you will likely need separate needles and
                        syringes. There are tutorials online of how to
                        put a needle onto a syringe.</p>
                        <p>If you are using separate needles and
                        syringes, you need to ‘clear the deadspace’,
                        after drawing your dose. Deadspace is the space
                        in your needle (the hub) that the plunger cannot
                        push medication out of. If you replace your
                        needle without clearing it, you lose the oil in
                        the drawing needle when swapping, and some of
                        your dose inside the syringe will fill the
                        injection needle’s deadspace instead of going
                        inside of you.</p>
                        <p>Using 0.1 mL as an example, after drawing
                        your dose and taking your needle out of the
                        vial, you will need to draw back the plunger to
                        draw the liquid inside the needle out of it and
                        into the syringe. Now you have
                        0.1 mL + deadspace + air inside the syringe.
                        Then detach the drawing needle and add the
                        injection needle, then carefully push up the
                        plunger until a tiny drop leaves the top of the
                        needle. The plunger is now at your dose of
                        0.1 mL, with the deadspace inside the injection
                        needle, and you can inject knowing you have the
                        right dose.</p>
                        <p>Using any gauge mentioned will work, but if
                        your vial has a thicker oil (e.g. castor) then
                        using a thicker gauge needle (such as 23G or
                        25G) will make drawing faster. Thinner needles
                        work fine but they will be slow. You can heat
                        the vial with your body heat to make drawing
                        quicker.</p>
                        <h2 data-number="5"
                        id="subcutaneous">Subcutaneous</h2>
                        <p>For subq you can use a needle between 27G and
                        31G that is between 8 mm (3/8ths inch) and 16 mm
                        (5/8ths inch). You can inject at a 45 or 90
                        degree angle, and pinch the skin + fat to create
                        enough space to put the needle in. If you are
                        getting leaking / bleeding from the site you can
                        leave the needle in for 10 seconds after
                        injecting. Injecting slowly will reduce
                        pain.</p>
                        <p>Rotate between at least 2 sites (e.g. left
                        thigh and right thigh) every injection, trying
                        to inject in different places each time. If you
                        do not do this you are at risk of depot buildup
                        and scarring will be inevitable.</p>
                        <p>The abdomen and thighs are the easiest places
                        to self-inject. Stay 2.5 cm away from the belly
                        button.</p>

                        27G that is between 1 inch (25 mm) and
                        1.5 inches (37 mm). Inject at a 90 degree
                        angle.</p>
                        <p>If you experience leaking from the site, try
                        the Z-track method (there are videos online).
                        Injecting slowly will reduce pain.</p>
                        <p>Rotate between at least 2 sites (e.g. left
                        thigh and right thigh) every injection, trying
                        to inject in different places each time. If you
                        do not do this you are at risk of depot buildup
                        and scarring will be inevitable.</p>
                        <p>The vastus lateralis and the ventrogluteal
                        are the easiest places to self-inject.</p>

                        <p>Some people use IM because they have more
                        than 0.5 mL to inject; or they experience more
                        irritation from injecting subq, and would rather
                        not take an antihistamine to reduce this, or
                        taking one doesn’t help. For most formulations
                        there is no difference between IM and subq (this
                        excludes EUn).</p>

                        tell my vial has problems?</h2>
                        <p>The main symptoms are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>a visible hole / leaking from the
                        stopper</li>
                        <li>particles inside it that do not dissolve
                        when vial is heated and shaken (you can heat it
                        by keeping it against your body until the vial
                        warms up to body temperature)</li>
                        <li>the crimp is loose (metal edges on the cap
                        of the vial)</li>
                        <li>colour changes (oil going dark yellow /
                        pink)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Do not use the vial if it has these symptoms.
                        It is not sterile, and you could get a serious
                        infection.</p>
                        <p>You must store the vial in a dark place
                        (e.g. in a cupboard / box) ideally away from
                        heat sources (e.g. not on top of a
                        radiator).</p>
                        <p>The stopper may bulge from pulling on it or
                        rapid temperature changes; try to avoid these
                        risk factors.</p>

                        id="what-dose-should-i-start-at">What dose
                        should I start at?</h2>
                        <p>This depends on what you’re taking. Note that
                        there is no benefit to basing your starting dose
                        from a baseline blood test.</p>
                        <p>For Oestradiol Enanthate (EEn) and Oestradiol
                        Cypionate (EC), 4 mg every week can suppress
                        testosterone for the vast majority of
                        transfemmes. For Oestradiol Valerate (EV), 4 mg
                        every 5 days or 5 mg every week. If you do a low
                        dose, you will likely just get breast
                        development and nothing else.</p>
                        <p>For Testosterone Enanthate (TE or TEn) and
                        Testosterone Cypionate (TC), 50 mg every week is
                        a standard starting dose for transmascs, but if
                        you want to do a low dose you can do 25 mg, and
                        a high dose at 100 mg.</p>
                        <p>You cannot do a low dose to avoid an effect
                        you don’t like.</p>
                        <p>These are average starting doses. To know
                        your levels are good for your long-term health,
                        you must have regular blood tests.</p>
                        <h2 data-number="9"
                        id="what-about-blood-tests">What about blood
                        tests?</h2>
                        <p>Get your blood tested between 4–6 weeks after
                        starting hormones. After this, every 6 to 12
                        months is fine for standard monotherapy.</p>
                        <p>Ideally test your hormones at trough, i.e. on
                        the same day you take your hormones, but before
                        you inject.</p>
                        <p>If you are taking only oestrogen, test E2
                        (Oestradiol) and T. If you are taking only
                        testosterone, test full blood count (FBC) and T.
                        You can test E2 to confirm menses have stopped
                        but it isn’t necessary. (‘Free oestrogen’ and
                        ‘Free Testosterone’ are the wrong tests. ‘Total
                        Testosterone’ is correct, ‘Total oestrogen’ is
                        wrong.)</p>
                        <p>For transfemmes taking oestrogen: at trough
                        your E2 should be between 370–740 pmol/L
                        (100–200 pg/mL), and T below 1.8 nmol/L
                        (50 ng/dL).</p>
                        <p>For transmascs taking testosterone: T should
                        be between 10–25 nmol/L (300–750 ng/dL, lower
                        near trough, higher at peak), FBC in male
                        range.</p>
                        <p>If you get results in different units,
                        converters for E and T exist online.</p>
                        <p>If your levels are high or low, change your
                        dosage accordingly, and retest after 4 to 6
                        weeks.</p>
                        <p>In the UK it’s cheapest to try and get a GP
                        to do your blood tests for you on the NHS, but
                        this has become much more difficult recently.
                        Sometimes you can ask if you can pay them to do
                        it, but your GP may not agree.</p>
                        <p>There are a few private clinics who will do
                        the relevant blood tests:
                        <a href="https://www.randox.com/" target="_blank">Randox</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.forthwithlife.co.uk/" target="_blank">Forth
                        With Life</a> and
                        <a href="https://www.medichecks.com/" target="_blank">Medichecks</a>
                        (and others). If you can get to London,
                        <a href="https://cliniq.org.uk/" target="_blank">cliniQ</a>
                        and
                        <a href="https://www.dean.st/trans-non-binary-2/" target="_blank">56T</a>
                        will do free blood tests.</p>
                        <p>With private clinics it’s highly recommended
                        you do an in-clinic test as the at-home / finger
                        prick test devices are often highly inaccurate
                        when it comes to hormone levels.</p>
                        <p>If you have weird symptoms but your blood
                        test results are fine, ask somebody competent
                        for advice.</p>
