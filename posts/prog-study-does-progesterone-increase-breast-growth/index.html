                <p>Whether progesterone promotes breast growth has long
                been an endless source of conversation within the

                discussions frequently provoke light-hearted but
                sometimes heated and polarizing debates that, more often
                than not, lead nowhere. Recently, results from an
                unpublished study (the infamous “prog study”)
                investigating the effect of progesterone on breast
                growth have been circulating online. While the fact that
                a clinical trial on the use of progesterone in transfem
                hormone therapy has been conducted was long overdue and
                most welcome, <strong>this specific study has too many
                methodological shortcomings, including possible
                statistical errors, for us to conclude that progesterone
                increases breast growth (or not)</strong>. As before,
                you can try it if you wish, but don’t get your hopes up
                too much.</p>

                Thus, the “double estrogen dose” groups were actually

                role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> have said that some
                participants opted to take it rectally without telling
                the study authors. In any event, <strong>actual
                progesterone levels for any group in the study have not

                rather than comparing participants’ breast sizes before
                and after treatment. In other words, the double E +
                200 mg P group didn’t have a “37% increase in breast
                volume”– rather, their increase was 37% greater than the
                increase the control group had (confusing isn’t
                it).</li>
                <li><strong>The authors did not measure breast size
                after discontinuing progesterone.</strong> progesterone
                is known to cause fluid retention which can impact

                the effect shown in the study is permanent growth or
                simply fluid retention is therefore unclear.</li>
                <li>15 people per group (total 90 people) is a small

                called for a statistical analysis that would treat
                predictors, stratification, interaction terms, and
                confounding variables appropriately using a mixed model
                approach, which would address the previous concerns. At
                the conference, however, the results were presented as
                five simple percent differences between each individual
                treatment group and the control. These differences
                appear to have been analyzed separately, rather than as
                fixed-effect coefficients within a single model. This
                reporting style suggests that the full mixed model
                analysis has yet to be performed or could not be
                completed. Possible reasons include missing data or poor
                data quality arising for example from participants’
                failure to adhere to the protocol.</li>

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Background</p>
                <p>Breast development as a result of feminizing
                gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is often
                limited. Therefore, many transgender individuals choose
                to undergo breast augmentation surgery. The addition of
                progesterone to feminizing GAHT and/or increasing the
                estradiol dose to improve breast growth are topics of
                international debate. Thus far, no prospective
                randomized studies have been performed.</p>
                <p>Methods</p>
                <p>We conducted a non-blinded, non-placebo, randomized
                controlled study in transgender individuals assigned
                male sex at birth, who had received feminizing GAHT for
                at least one year and had undergone
                vaginoplasty/orchiectomy. Ninety participants were
                randomized into six groups, using a factorial design,
                receiving the standard dose of estradiol (E , control),
                the standard dose of estradiol and micronized
                progesterone 200 mg daily (EP), the standard dose of
                estradiol and micronized progesterone 400 mg daily
                (EPP), twice the standard dose of estradiol (EE), twice
                the standard dose of estradiol and micronized
                progesterone 200 mg daily (EEP), or twice the standard
                dose of estradiol and micronized progesterone 400 mg
                daily (EEPP), all for a duration of 12 months. The
                primary objective was to investigate the change in
                breast volume (in %), which was quantified by 3D
                measurements at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months.
                Secondary objectives included assessment of safety and
                satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Results</p>
                <p>Baseline characteristics were comparable among the
                groups. In comparison to group E (control), the mean
                percentage increase in breast volume over time was 13%
                (95% CI -7 to 33) in group EP, 20% (0 to 40) in group
                EPP, 6% (-13 to 24) in group EE, 37% (18 to 57) in group
                EEP, and 27% (8 to 47) in group EEPP. There were no
                treatment-related serious adverse events. Frequently
                reported side effects among participants using
                progesterone were tiredness (44%), breast/nipple
                tenderness (27%), and mood changes (22%). Satisfaction
                with breast growth and size improved in all study groups
                compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05).</p>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                <p>This is the first prospective study to demonstrate
                that the addition of progesterone and increasing the
                estradiol dose results in increased breast volume in
                transgender individuals already using feminizing GAHT,
                along with increased satisfaction with their breasts. In
                this study, use of progesterone was safe but did cause
                some side effects. The results support a future role for
                progesterone in feminizing GAHT. Further research should
                focus on long-term effects of progesterone as part of
                feminizing GAHT regimens.<a href="#fnref1"

                <p>Yeah it changes a lot indeed, <strong>I was in a very
                big dilemma at a time wether to tell the researchers or
                not that most of them were just taking it
                rectally</strong>; most of the girls were asking about
                progesterone back then due to Will Powers’ Method for a
                couple of years. Vumc didn’t want to prescribe it at
                all.</p>
                <p>I think due to these reasons and the increase of
                girls asking about it they decided to study it, except
                they ignored the fact that Powers recommends rectal
                administration, which <strong>most of these girls
                knew/did in secret (at least 5 of them; maybe more but I
                don’t know them) due to fear of not being able to
                receive the progesterone otherwise.</strong></p>
                <p>Sadly <strong>I decided not to say anything in that
                moment due to constant mistreatment by that clinic
                towards me, and it probably would’ve killed the study
                since it was already going for 6 months at the time when
                I joined</strong>….</p>
                <p>some of these girls were desperate for adequate
                care/bad financial state so I just couldn’t bring myself
                to tell them. Anyway, now that the study is over I
                might, but I fear they will stop progesterone for them.
                I don’t have the energy now since I am currently in a
                formal complaint battle with one of their docs (not with
                the researchers) and recovering from an Anterior Uveitis
                episode.</p>
